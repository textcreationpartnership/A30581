         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46564:10"/> as much as ever man did that we either ever read of, or ever heard of; all his care was to Magnifie, yea indeed to Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Jeſus Chriſt; the very name of Chriſt was as ſugar in his mouth, and rolled up and down under his tongue; He himſelf had taſted upon his ſpirit much of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the grace of God in Chriſt; and he labors much to make this known unto others, that they might likewiſe experience the ſweetneſſe thereof. And in theſe two verſes there is as much ſet forth of the grace of God in the Goſpel as I know in any two verſes together in all the Book of God.</p>
               <p>We have here ſet out unto us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of Reconciliation between God, and man.</p>

               <p>As for this 19. verſe we heave here. Firſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Reconciliation: to wit; <hi>That God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them.</hi> And in that you have theſe Two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Doctrine of Reconciliation ſet down more generally; Namely; <hi>that God was in Chriſt Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, An inſtance in one ſpecial great work of God, <hi>in Reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhal make an enterance into the firſt of theſe and ſo proceed; namely, The Doctrine of Reconciliation ſet down more generally. <hi>That God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> Notes and implies; that there was a formal breach between God, and us: we cannot underſtand what it is to be Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, except we do beforehand know ſomwhat about the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46564:10"/> Breach which this Reconciliation muſt make up. It doth implie an enmity that there was between man and God; for if two be reconciled, then certainly, it implys, that once there was an enmity between them. <hi>Conciliari</hi> is to bring into favor, but <hi>Reconciliari,</hi> is to bring into favor again thoſe that have bin in favor before, and between whom there hath been a Breach; therefore <hi>to bring into feavor again;</hi> is in playn tearms, <hi>Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And in the opening of this doctrine therfore, there are theſe particulars that playnly lie before us in the Text; for I wil go no further in the opening of the Doctrine of Reconciliation but meerly to that which you have lying obviouſly, and plainly before you in the words. In which you have theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That which is implied; namely, That there was a bleſſed Union at the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, but this was broken, and there was an enmity after that union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man. I put theſe Two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely that after the firſt union that was between God and Man, there was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between God and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is yet a way to have this Breach made up; there is a poſsibillity for man that is at enmity with God, to be Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ſhal open to you, wherein this Reconciliation doth conſiſt; what that Reconciliation is which the text ſpeaks of, and which the Goſpel doth tender unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:46564:11"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We ſhal ſhew the principal cauſe of this, how this Reconciliation did begin. It was God himſelf that did begin with us, we did not begin with him to make peace, God did firſt begin with us, or there would never have peace been made between him and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>We ſhal ſhew in whom this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is made; it is in Jeſus Chriſt; which indeed is the principal thing of al; and that wherein the miſtery of the Goſpel lies: and when we come to that, we ſhal open the Miſtery of this Reconciliation.</hi> And then,</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>Further from what time this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation hath been. It</hi> [was] <hi>ſaith the Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. 2.</hi> That there was a breach made between God and man after a bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</head>
               <p>IN the firſt Chapter we have much work cut out. Some of the particulars I wil paſs over very briefly, for my ſcope and drift is to open to you the Evangelical part of this Text, and to inſiſt ſpecially upon what is plainly expreſſed, rather than to inſiſt on what is implyed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot treat of what is expreſſed without treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little of what is implyed: Therefore in a few lines of that, and ſo paſs on.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That which is implyed, is, That there is a Breach made between God and us after Union (I put theſe two together) There was at firſt a bleſſed union between God and man-kind; God did make man in a happy eſtate according to his own Image, that is, in perfect holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe. When he had made al other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he makes man as his choſen Creature, ſtamps upon him his own image, to the end that he might by man have his glory from al the other Creatures that were made, that he might in this world have a creature which might be able to know him, and to worſhip him, and to ſerve him, and to take notice of the luſtre of his glory that aroſe from al his other works, and to reflect this glory upon his face: and he made man a Creture fit to do this work. Man was very hapy in his firſt creation in this thing, that God made him of al his creaturs fit for ſuch a buſineſs to reflect his own glory upon his own face, and ſo to injoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf, which no creature in the world, except the Angels which were in Heaven, were capable of. And the Lord loved this creature, and took delight in him, therefore it is obſervable in that 1. <hi>Gen</hi> the laſt, that though when he beheld all his other works, he only ſaid that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46564:12"/> were <hi>good;</hi> yet when the ſixt day came wherein man was made, the text ſaith, that he ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was <hi>very good:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Every particular Creature was good taken by it ſelf, good as from God, good in their qualities &amp; effects, wth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, either guilt or hurt. But now taken altogether are <hi>very good,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing man was made who is the moſt excellent of all Gods viſible works in the morning of his creation.</note> obſerve it, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid <hi>very good,</hi> till the laſt day, till man is made; there is not this Commendation of the works of God mentioned till he had made man; and the reaſon is indeed, becauſe the Lord did not take ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all the works he had made in this world, untill he had made man, man was the very complement of all the excellencies of Gods works; for indeed he was the End of all his works, he made all the other for man, and man for himſelf. God hath not his glory, I meane not immediatly from al his other works in the world, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through man, and had it not been for man, he had loſt the greateſt part of his glory in the reſt of his works; his glory paſſeth from all the works that he made, unto him through man. Now therefore though the works that God made, the Heaven, the Earth, and the Seas, and the like, were good in themſelves; yet, what glory could God have had in all theſe? he could have no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theſe Creatures after they were made, and theſe Creatures could have no communion with him; none of them could know God, or take any notice of God, or praiſe God actively. God is a pure act, and he is not content with having his glory paſſively, but he muſt have his glory actively: It is true, al his Creatures were made as an inſtrument in tune; but there was none to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and though there be never ſo much of the glory of God in all the Creatures in the world, yet if man had not been made, none could have ſounded forth this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; thoſe Creatures had been Dumb in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, like an inſtrument that cannot of it ſelf ſound forth any muſick unleſſe there were ſome to play upon it:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46564:12"/> and ſo it is here, God had made all other Creatures very good, and there was in them matter of Gods praiſe; but now, to the end that this praiſe and glory of God may be ſounded forth, he brings in man, and he gives him skil to praiſe the name of God in all theſe Creatures; and in this God delighted very much.</p>
               <p>Thus there was a moſt bleſſed union, and a wonderful delight between God and Man at firſt; but the truth is, this union was ſoone broken, and man in a ſmal time, did come to be (next to the Devills) the moſt deadly enemy that God had, though there was a moſt bleſſed union between God and man at firſt; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> could walk, and Converſe with God, as he did for a while; yet <hi>Adam</hi> ſins againſt God and turns a moſt diſperate enemy againſt God; even he himſelf, and all his poſterity; therefore you ſhal obſerve in the ſtory where the fall of man is ſet forth; that as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, the voice of God which he did but hear in the Garden, became terrible to him, and he preſently ſeekes to hide himſelf; he was Conſcious to himſelf that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is the woeful fruit of ſin, even of the firſt ſin, of the fal of our firſt Parents; and ſince the world began, ſince that very time, this man, this <hi>Adam</hi> hath begotten none but enemies unto God; and if there be any truth in the word of God, this is certaine, That there was never any Child of <hi>Adam</hi> but was born an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46564:13"/> enemy unto God; the Scripture is as Cleere in this, as in any thing; I might name abundance of texts for it, which for brevity ſake I ſhal omit. Rom. 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were Reconciled unto God:</hi> Certainly if any men in the world were not enemies unto God, they are thoſe that are Reconciled afterward; but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes of himſelf and of all other Chriſtians that are Reconciled unto God; he ſaith, that they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto him: this may be ſaid of every man child in the world; that he is an enemy unto God; and ſuch enemies are every one of us unto God naturally, as that there is an antipathy between our hearts and him; and the enmity of antipathy is the greateſt; it is not an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity occaſioned by ſome il carriage in one act: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Two men, though they were great freinds before, yet there may be ſome miſcarriage between them, that they may be as enemies for a while; but that is not al: the enmity that is on mans part againſt God, is in his very nature. It is true, there was a ſinful act brought it in firſt, and made a breach between God and man; but that is not al, it went further, there was by this ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten in the heart of man an antipathy, a natural anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between him, and God; ſo that the poyſon of a Toad in the Body of a man is not more oppoſite, and there is not a greater enmity to the nature of man, than the nature of man is oppoſite, and an enemy unto God himſelf. Two ſheep may fight one againſt another by occaſion and be as enimies one with another; but two ſheep can never be at enmity one with another, as the Wolfe and the Lamb are, for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is natural; their natures are oppoſite one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: So the heart of man is oppoſite unto God even naturally. And know this: that there is in mans nature not only a hatred of God, but a deadly hatred. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may think you are free from this; but Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this is in every one of your hearts naturally, even
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46564:13"/> in thoſe that have the beſt natures in the world, as you call them: there is in their hearts a hatred; nay, a deadly hatred againſt God. But you wil ſay, God forbid: what, hate God? Se that Scripture in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Where when the Apoſtle reckons up the evil of thoſe that were in their natural Condition, verſe 13. he ſaith, that they were haters of God: and what the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of them, he intendeth of all, for that is his ſcope in that place to ſhew our natural condition, and that therfore we cannot be juſtified by any works of our own, but it muſt be by faith in Chriſt, becauſe we are by nature haters of of God. And in the ſecond Commandment ye have that expreſſed, even of thoſe that ſeem to be the greateſt lovers of God, that would be thought to love God more than any people, that wil deviſe pictures to worſhip God by; and beſtow much coſt upon them, and they ſaie, it is for the honour of God, and who would not think but that theſe men loved God exceedingly; yet though theſe men may be thought to be Lovers of God; there is no Commandment in which the breakers of it are ſaid to be haters of God, but in that Commandment; he wil viſſit the inniquity of the Fathers upon the Children unto third, and fourth, genneration of them that hate him; that is, upon thoſe that howſoever they; pretend love unto him in their falſe worſhip, yet they hate him. So that certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a hatred, yea, deadly hatered in the heart of man by nature againſt God. But you will ſay: how doth that appeare: or wherein doth the deadly hatred of God conſiſt? In this. When one man hates another ſo as he would wiſh him dead, he would wiſh him out of the way: he would wiſh him that he were not: ſuch a kind of hatred is therein every mans heart naturally: which <hi>I</hi> make plaine, thus. The very nature of God is holyneſs it ſelf: and if God ſhould be leſs holy than he is, he ſhould looſe his very Being: or if God ſhould be leſs juſt than he is, he would looſe his life, and ceaſe to be. Now I put this queſtion to you, to you that are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46564:14"/> wicked men, that are unconverted, have you not ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſecret wiſh in your hearts, that God were not ſo holy as he is; could you not wiſh in your hearts that God were not ſo juſt as he is; that he did not hate Sin as he doth; and why would you not have God ſo holy, and ſo juſt as he is? even becauſe you might have the more liberty in your way of ſin; that you might have more freedom in fulfilling the luſt of the fleſh; is not this in your hearts oftentimes; ſee then what it comes to, it is as much as if he ſhould ſay? my heart is ſo ſet upon ſuch, and ſuch a laſt, that I had rather God ſhould ceaſe to be God, than I ſhould not have liberty to injoy that luſt; this is the very plaine engliſh of it; though you do not come to that height to ſay ſo, in ſo many words, for I ſuppoſe none of you to be ſo abominably wicked, or that ever came to that height of impiety, as to ſay plainly with your mouths, I love ſuch a luſt ſo dearely, that I would rather God ſhould not be God, than I looſe my luſt. But you are to know that there is a language in your actions, as wel as in your words; &amp; God can underſtand the language of your actions, as wel as the expreſſions of your mouths. Now, it is apparent that when a man loves his luſt ſo wel, as that to the end he may have the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the injoyment of it, he could ſecretly wiſh that God were not ſo infinitly holy, and juſt as he is; certainly there is this in it; that he doth in effect deſire, and wiſh that God might rather ceaſe to bee, then that he might not have his luſt; and is not this a deadly hatred? thou doſt ſo far love thy luſt, as that thou haſt a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hatred againſt God, whoſe holyneſs, and juſtice thou knoweſt to be ſo infinite, as that they are both ſet againſt it; and therefore for the better injoyment of thy luſt, thou couldeſt wiſh, that God were neither ſo holy, nor ſo juſt as he is; which is in effect to wiſh that he were not God. For if he ſhould ceaſe to be holy or leſs holy, &amp; leſs juſt than he is, he ſhould ceaſe to be God. And truly if we rightly underſtood our own natures in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46564:14"/> there is nothing wil break the heart of a man more than it: what can break the heart of a man more, than to ſit down and conſider; I am an enemy unto God; and I have been in enmity againſt God al my dayes, and therefore what can I expect, but that God ſhould be an enemy unto me everlaſtingly. This is that which wil ſtrike down the proudeſt heart in the world. And let me tel you; till you come to ſee ſin thus, you do not ſee it to any purpoſe. But though this argument may take up my treatiſe, yet becauſe I mention it to make way to that which remaines, and which I principally ayme at in the doctrine of Reconciliation: I ſhal therefore paſs it over.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Would it not now be joyful news to you to hear of a poſſibility for God to be Reconciled to you? You ſee there is an enmity in your hearts to God; and not only an enmity; but a moſt deadly, and deſperate one. I could ſhew you abundance of particulars of this enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the maine thing that <hi>I</hi> ayme at, is, only to open the Doctrine of Reconciliation: therefore if thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeſt this truth of God; and if God hath darted it into thy Conſcience: wil not the Doctrine of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation be acceptable to thee? O! it would; and it is unto thoſe that feare God, and rightly apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as enemies unto him. But <hi>I</hi> fear, leaſt while I am treating of the Doctrine of Reconciliation between God you, you ſhould not apprehend the excellency of it, and not relliſh it in the ſweetneſs of it. And therefore if <hi>I</hi> have ſaid any thing that ſeems to be terrible to you in my other treatiſes. If <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed to you what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and dangerous Condition you are in naturally,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46564:15"/> and how liable to the wrath of God, and to the torments of Hel, where the worme dies not, &amp; the fier goes not out; it is al to this end; that you might the better reliſh the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſweet doctrine of Reconciliation between God, and your Souls. This is that then which we ſhall begin withal, as the firſt ſound of the bleſſed Silver Trumpet of the Goſpel; namely;</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That there is a way to make up a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and ſinful man.</hi> God hath not left man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who hath Sunk himſelf into ſuch a depth of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I ſay, God hath not left them irrecoverable irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable: the Lord doth here profeſſe unto you, that he is willing to be reconciled unto you; yea, we ſhal ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that he doth intreat you to be reconciled. But here is the firſt ſound of the Trumpet of the Goſpel, and bleſſed are they that hear this joyful ſound: namly, that there is a poſſiblity of being reconciled; that the Lord is content to enter into parly with his enemies, for God might have caſt them off forever, and never ſo much as parly with them, as he hath done the Angels that ſinned, againſt whom he was ſo provoked, that he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved within himſelf, and he hath kept his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſince the beginning of the world, and he will keep it unto all eternity, that he wil not ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into parly with thoſe Creatures, or be reconciled with them upon any tearms. As when a man is ſo fallen out with an another, as that if one ſhould come to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout terms of peace, he cannot endure to hear of them; no, ſaith he, I will never enter into treaty with him ſo long as I live, about it. So God wil never enter into treaty with the Angels, he wil not hear of any terms of Reconciliation, but is reſolved to revenge himſelf upon them to al eternity: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, they are reſerved in chains to the judgmtnt of the great day. But now, Lord what ſhal become of man? poor man might well fear, when he hears what God hath reſolved upon againſt the Angels, he hath cauſe enough to ſhake
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46564:15"/> at that, for indeed man is a far more poore, and mean, and wretched Creature than thoſe Angels are. If it be ſo between man, and man, that when a great Prince is offended with ſome Noble man in his Court, and ſo offended with him, yea, for his firſt offence, as that all the men in the world cannot perſwade that Prince ſo much as to vouchſafe to hearken to any terms of reconciliation, and if ſome meaner officer, ſome poore Groom ſhal have offended the King, and provoked his wrath, and hears of this, that his Cheif favorite, one that was neer unto him; that was alwaies in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did but offend him once, and yet the King ſhould never hearken to any means of pacification: ſurely this man would ſoon think with himſelf, Lord what wil become of me,? Is there any hope that there ſhal be a parly between the King and me? Certainly this poor man wil even be ready to have his heart ſink within him, and ſit down altogether overwhelmed with fear, and diſpaire. And ſo indeed ſhould we all have done upon our reaſoning within our ſelves concerning Gods dealing with the fallen Angels, had we not had this glorious, and bleſſed ſound of the Goſpel, and hopes of Reconciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt, we would all have ſunk down into the battomleſſe Gulf of diſpaire, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded certainly againſt our ſelves, that there can be no peace between God and us, we being ſuch enemies unto him as we are by nature. But though this be beyond our thoughts as farr as the Heaven is above the Earth; and though this could never enter into the heart of man, that ever God would parly with poor falen man after ſo great an emnity begot by ſin; yet know, this is the meſſage that is come from Heaven, even from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he is contented to parly with you; yea, ſo Contented, as that he himſelf hath ſent ambaſſadors to us to intreat us be reconciled. But of that hereafter. God I ſay is Content to enter into treaty with man concerning

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46564:17"/> a Reconciliation and the making up of a peace between him, and their ſouls; for that indeed is the very ſcope of the Goſpel. If I ſhould a little dwell here to inquire the Reaſon of this, why the Lord ſhould be willing to enter into this treaty with man-kind: the truth is, it is an unſearchable depth, we cannot imagine any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord ſhould rather chuſe to parly with us, and to treat concerning terms of peace with us than with the Angels. There is ſomething indeed which we may have in our thoughts; As thus. If God did not Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile himſelf to man, and ſave him, he ſhould looſe his whole Creature; he did not looſe all the Angels when they fell, but if God ſhould not provide a way to be Reconciled to man, the whole kind of that Creature would be utterly loſt: now the Lord wil not caſt away the whole kind of ſuch an excellent Creature as man is. But the truth is, theſe are but gueſſes at this Reaſon in chuſing to treat with us about ſalvation, and not with the Angels. But the main thing is: God hath waies to glorifie himſelf that we know not of in reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to man-kind. We know this, that there are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intentions that God hath in this work, but what theſe are, we ſhal never know througbly til we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that indeed wil be the very work of Heaven it ſelf to be praiſing of God to all eternity for that great act of his, namely his willingneſſe to be reconciled to loſt man, rather than to the fallen Angels. We ſhal know ſome Reaſons of that afterward, for God doth things according to the Counſel of his wil; and there is nothing he doth, but he hath a great deal of Reaſon for which we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore though we cannot now fully underſtand. Only for the preſent let me hint this unto you; let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of but thus much affect your hearts. O ſhould we be ſent to preach to the Devils ſuch a point as this is, or to the Angels in Hell; and ſay, the Lord hath kept this Councel from you almoſt this ſix thouſand
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46564:17"/> years, and his waies towards you have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o as if he would never enter parly with you, but now God hath revealed his wil towards you, that he is content to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Treaty with you about the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your peace, and the reconciling of you unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what a meſſage would this be to them think you? but this never was, nor never ſhal be preached unto them. If God ſhould ſend this meſſage to the damned in Hel, and ſay to them, the Lord is content to enter into a parly with you about the reconciling of himſelf unto you, what a meſſage would this be to them? but this cannot be; this is only a meſſage to thoſe that are alive here in this world, to that part of the children of men that are living upon the earth, unto them only can this be preached, that there is a poſſibility of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and them. Truly the conſideration of a poſſibility is that which may ſatisfie the heart of man, let the terms be what they wil. O! is it poſſible that God may be reconciled, I wil never inquire about the terms out of fear that the hardneſſe of them ſhould diſcourage me; O! let the terms be what they will, this is the moſt acceptable news, this is the beſt tidings to my ſoul, more acceptable than it I were told, that I had a thouſand worlds given unto me, even this that I hear, that there is a poſsiblity of reconciliation betwixt God and my ſelf. This may ſerve to be ſome prop to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and keep up any troubled Conſcience from diſpair, even the very reading of this, though ſtill they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Gods willingneſſe to make up the peace, but it is poſsible thou may'ſt have it. No Angel in Heaven, Nor man in the world, do, or can know to the contrary, but that it is poſsible for thee, and thee, for ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as thou art, or ſuch as thou art to come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
               <p>And doth this begin a little to ſtir thy heart, but to read that the Condition of man is not deſperate, but there is a poſſibility of his being Reconciled: do'ſt thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46564:18"/> believe becauſe of this? then (as Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi>) thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe. So, if thy heart begin to be affected by this: thou ſhalt before we have done with this ſubject, read greater things of the councel of God about his willingneſs to be reconciled unto the Children of men.</p>
               <p>Only before I paſs let me ſpeak this one Word about this point. Let us take heed that we do not turne this grace of God that we hear of this day, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our more fearful condemnation, or make our condemnation far more dreadful then the condemnation of the Devils is, becauſe we have more means afforded us for our delivery than ever they had, for if we look not to it, it may prove ſo, that our condemnation may be more dreadful then the condemnation of the Devils; and therefore you had need, when you hear anything of this Decoctine of Reconciliation, or of a poſſibillity of being reconciled unto God, to lift up your hearts unto God, and deſire that the reading of this bleſſed Doctrine may not prove to the increaſe of your condemnation. There is not ſuch a thing preached to the Devils; therefore if I come not in, and accept of the terms, of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhal be in worſe caſe than the Devils. It can never be charged upon them, that God was willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and they would not; but it may be thus ſaid of al wicked and ungodly men, that live under the ſound of the Goſpel, and ſo Continue in their wickedneſs, and die in it: this wil be the charge that wil lie upon them another day; and God wil ſaie unto them; you did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hear that you were naturally enemies to me; yet I manifeſtd in my Goſpell, that <hi>I</hi> would enter into terms of peace with you, but you refuſed it, and ſlighted it, and ſcorned it. What can poſſibly provoke the heart of a man ſo much as this, that when he hath his enemy who hath deeply offended him, at an advantage, ſhould yet offer tearms of peace to him; and yet his enemy goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſcorning, ſlighting and contemning him. Truly, thus do
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46564:18"/> wicked men that live under the light of the Goſpel; when the Miniſters of the Goſpel come, and preach peace and Reconciliation to them; tel them, that God is willing to be at peace with them; that he is willing to treat, and to parly with them about the buſineſs of ſalvation; they go away, and the language of their actions is this; wel, we wil ſhift as wel as we can for our ſelves, we are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have our waies of ſin, and to have our Satisfaction in this, and the other luſt. Now God forbid that this ſhould be in the heart of any one that caſts his eyes on this book.</p>

               <p n="3">III. Therefore <hi>I</hi> am in the third place to open a little further this grace of God, the doctrine of Reconciliation, and it is a moſt bleſſed, and ſweet doctrine, eſpecially in theſe times wherein there are ſo many Cumbuſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, wherein we heare of Warrs and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of Wars, yea, of Wars neer to us, even in our own land, our bowels, what can be more acceptable in ſuch times as theſe, than to hearof Reconciliation; Now when things are growen to ſuch a height, when there is ſuch a deadly hatred (for let me tel you, there was never ſuch a deadly hatred in a Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one party, and another, as there is now) it is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up to the higheſt; as poyſon, may be boyled up to ſuch a height, as that it may be death to touch it: ſo the poyſon, and rage of our adverſaries is boyled up to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46564:19"/> greateſt height. But though we are not able to Conceive that there can be a Reconciliation between them and us, yet there may be a poſſibility of a Reconciliation between God and us, and the hearing of the Doctrine of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, may quiet, and ſupport our hearts againſt the feare, and truoble that we have in theſe times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have nothing but rumors of wars round about us yea in the mideſt of al theſe miſeries which we hear of, as the effect of theſe unnatural broyles that are amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Now the Doctrine, it may be opened in theſe ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this. That enmity which we have heard of before, when once God comes to be Reconciled to a ſoul, is al done away; al that enmity, is then ſo removed, as that the wayes of the Lord to a man are turned quite contrary to that they have formerly been; which I ſhal afterwards diſcover in the effect of this Reconciliation more fully. But this is the firſt thing; the doing away of all that wrath, and diſpleaſure that was in the heart of God againſt the ſinner; ſo that if it were poſſible that you could but look into the heart of God, you ſhould not ſee any remainder of that wrath, and diſpleaſure that was in him, becauſe of ſin. It is true, if we do conſider of God in al his workings together, from Election to glorification; it wil be hard to affirme, that ever God ſhould be in a way of enmity againſt his Elect ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did alwaies love them; for the truth is; though we conceive Gods works by peeces, yet they are al one in him; but if we would underſtand God aright, we muſt underſtand him in releation to his Creature, and in releation unto himſelf; for as God is in himſelf, it is impoſſible for us to underſtand him: but, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him in reference to his Creatures; there we find, that one excellency of God is cut into ſeveral peeces, and parts; and that one act of God, which is his own being is diſcovered in ſeveral waies of acting.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:46564:19"/>
               <p>There are a great many miſtakes about God when as men do draw Conſequences from what God is in himſelf, to bring them to what God is in relation to his Creature; and becauſe they cannot reconcile theſe two; namely, what God is infinitly in himſelf, (which is above our apprehenſion) and what God is in his manifeſtation to the Creature, not being able to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ncile thoſe Two, they draw moſt abſurd, and vile Conſequences from God. Sometimes they look upon God in himſelf, and ſomtimes upon God as he is to the Creature, and not being able to diſtinguiſh, they miſtake the waies of God exceedingly. As thus: If you would look upon God as he is in himſelf; there are not two Attributes in his Eſſence: that which we cal <hi>Mercy,</hi> and that which we call <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> is one and the ſame in God. That which we call <hi>Love,</hi> and that which we call <hi>Hatred,</hi> in God is al one, but in us they are two things: In man, Juſtice is one thing, and power, is another thing, and patience is another thing, and love is another thing; but in God, al theſe are but one infinite Eſſence. And ſo for actions, ſomtimes we conceive of God acting one way, and then another way. Firſt, acting in the way of his wrath, and then in the way of his love; but God himſelf is one pure act, and when we look upon God in himſelf, we can ſee him but abſolutely one in his own nature, there is no ſuch Attributes as we ſpeak of, it is but onely according to mans Capacity, and according to the ſeveral waies of the manifeſtation of Gods own infinite Eſſence, and of the ſeveral actions of God. But when we look upon God in reference to the Creature, we ſee God as it were divided. As for example: when the Sun ſhines, and the Beames thereof appear, if you put a green, or a blew, or a red glaſſe between your eye and it, then the reflection wil be blew, or green, or red, according to the coler of the glaſſe; yet in the mean time, the Beams of the Sun are al one: then take the ſame glaſſe that is blew, if you can but make it green, the ſhining of the Sun will be green to, all the variety is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46564:20"/> in the glaſſe, not in the Sun. So God is the ſame forever; but according to the ſeveral Conditions men are in, ſo are the workings of God towards that Creature. As now; man in the ſtate of innocency, he was as it were a white cleer glaſs, and God ſhined there in a way of goodneſſe, and love to man: the ſame man fals, and is dyed red by his ſin; let him be now preſented unto God, then the waies of God are bloody, and ſhew full of wrath. Let this man again be converted unto God and now the glaſs is changed and God repreſenteth himſelf another way, but ſtill the ſame God; only according to the ſeveral waies of the Creature, ſo are his ſeveral actings. Therefore thoſe that wil go to ſpeak of God as he is in himſelf, who is but one act, they are apt to lead you into abundance of errors, becauſe they are not able to mannage their apprehenſions of him as he is in himſelf; therefore they draw ſuch ill Conſequences from God. They wil tel you that God is unchangable, how then can you be under the wrath of God, when he loves you from all eternity? Yes; The ſame God that can look upon the Creature in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration with love; he may look upon the ſame Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in another Conſideration with hatred. <hi>We Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>were the Children of wrath as well as others by nature;</hi> in that reſpect there was no difference between us, and others. I will but put this to theſe men: Was not there a time when Jeſus Chriſt was under Gods wrath? yet God loved his Son from al eternity, he alwaies loved him; yet, there was a time when he was under the wrath of God; that is, Chriſt being preſented unto God with our nature, with our ſins, Gods ways towards him was (as we may ſay) in a red way: ſo we may underſtand, that even thoſe that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, God loving of them from all eternity, they may yet be in a ſtate of enmity unto God, he working upon the Creature according to the ſeveral Conſiderations of it; ſo that while he is walking contrary unto God, God is alſo walking contrary unto him. So that thus you ſee what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46564:20"/> this Reconciliation is. This enmity is taken away; that is, whereas before God did ſhine upon them through a red reflection; now that is gone, and he ſhines upon them through a white glaſs; this dreadful wrath of his that is out againſt them, and that Contrariety of God in his waies againſt them is quite taken away. This is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Second thing in reconciliation is this: not only the enmity that is in God is done away; but the Lord alſo doth take away the enmity on the ſouls part; that is, Thou comeſt by vertue of this Reconciliation to be ſo overpowred by the ſpirit of God, as that thou haſt a heart in amity with God; at leaſt that natural croſneſs and perverſneſs of thy heart againſt God whereby thou doſt hate God and that which is holy and ſpiritual, is taken away, and thou haſt a frameable ſpirit, framed by God, and made willing to come in and ſubmit, and yeild thy ſelf unto God: God puts a Reconcilable ſpirit into thee, as he himſelf hath a Reconcilable ſpirit towards thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Further, in the third place: There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into intire love: not only a ceaſing of the wrath, and of the enmity that is in God againſt thee, and a tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the enmity that is in thee againſt God: but there is a receiving into intire love, and that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, God receiveth thee into the love of a friend, and thou receiveſt God into the love of a friend too, ſo that there was never ſuch an intire friendſhip between one friend and another after peace hath been made between them, as there is now between God and thy ſoul. And this is more than barely to be pacified, for men who were at enmity one with another may poſſibly come to have the fierceneſs of their enmity taken away, yea they may come to be ſo far Reconciled, as that they wil never do one another hurt, they wil never fight the one againſt the other as formerly they did: But yet perhaps for all this, they wil never come to be: intirely loving one to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46564:21"/> another: it may be they wil live as ſtrangers one towards another. But when ever the ſoul comes to be Reconciled to God, there is a through Reconciliation, the enmity is not only taken away, but there is an intire love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoul, thou art made a friend unto God, and God is become a friend unto thee Yea.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the fourth place, there is this in Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation likewiſe. Thou comeſt now to be in league with God, God and thee come to ſhake hands one with another, yea, more than ſhake hands; thou comeſt to be one of his own people, God takes thee into an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with himſelf, and thou takeſt him to be thy God in an everlaſting Covenant likewiſe. As when Princes have War one againſt another, there may be a peace made, and they may lay down reaſons on both ſides, but al this while they may not come in to a league of friendſhip, and amity one with another. But God is ſo Reconciled to a ſoul, as that he entereth into a League with the ſoul, entereth into Covenant.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Lord when he is Reconciled to a ſoul, he is <hi>perfectly</hi> Reconciled, we may give it that word, for the truth is, it is ſuch a Reconciliation, ſo perfect, as that there ſhal not remain the leaſt grudg in the heart of God towards a man Reconciled. It is true, on our ſide it is not ſo perfect, but on Gods ſide it is ſo perfect a Reconciliation as that there ſhal not remaine the leaſt grudg in the heart of God againſt the Creature for any hurt to the Creature.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Yea, ſuch is the Reconciliation, as that it is everlaſting, ſuch a Reconciliation, as there ſhal never be breach made more, ſuch a Reconciliation, as there ſhal never be a falling out more. And where was there ever ſuch a peace made between one man and another? when was ever one man ſo Reconciled unto another, as that a man may ſay, wel, theſe two are thus, and thus Reconciled who were at deadly enmity before? yea, they are ſo Reconciled, as that there wil never more be any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46564:21"/> breach between them: ſo Reconciled, as that all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be done in the world ſhal never break the bond of friendſhip that is between them. Here is a Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to purpoſe, and this Reconcilement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and every Beleeving Soul at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when thou firſt comeſt to Jeſus Chriſt, God ſhakes hands with thee, entereth into League with thee, become a friend to thee, is ſo Reconciled unto thee, as that there ſhal be nothing in the world ſhal ever break the Atonement that is made between God thy Soul. You ſhal ſee how God himſelf expreſſeth it; in that 54. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. ſpeaking to his Church about this very word of Rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nciliation, he ſaith: <hi>The mountaines ſhall depart, and the Hils be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my Peace be removed ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> This Scripture, though ſpoken to the Church, is true of every beleeving ſoul. Do you think that Mountains are firm? many ſtormes, and tempeſts may be abroad; but all the ſtormes in the world cannot remove the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Look, ſaith God how firm, and ſteady the mountains are, So firm ſhall my mercy be to thee, and the Covenant of my peace. Hath God had mercy upon thy ſoul, and hath he been reconciled unto thee? know then, it is ſuch a Reconciliation as is more ſtable, and firm than the very mountains themſelves. O! this is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, the top of Reconciliation, that it is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reconciliation; So that notwithſtanding, though ſome of Gods waies may perhaps be towards you as if you were an enemy, God may ſo appear to you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yet peace is to thee; God intends no hurt at all, howſoever he may look ſomtimes as an enemy, yet at that time he means thee not the leaſt hurt. All the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that befall thee, they do not come from God as from an enemy, though perhaps through thy weakneſſe thou ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'ſt think ſo; for though God be Reconciled to thee in ſo gracious a way, yet if he correct thee, thou
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46564:22"/> art apt to look upon him as an enemy; No, it is thy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, Gods Reconciliation is a through Reconciliation, and may ſtand with all thoſe Corrections that he uſeth towards thee.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Yea, this Reconciliation wil continue conſtant, notwithſtanding all thoſe ſins of thine, which indeed of their own nature make breaches between God, and man. Take heed of abuſing ſuch a doctrine as this is. Thy ſins cannot overcome Gods goodneſs; O! let Gods goodneſs overcome thy wickedneſſe: for that is certain; the Lord when he was firſt reconciled to thee, he did know that there would be many failings, and fallings out, as it were, but yet he was reſolved to be reconciled; and that that receconciliation ſhould continue notwithſtanding all thoſe failings: and thy ſins, though they may change ſome adminiſtrations of God towards thee, ſo that he may ſeverely Correct thee, yet they ſhall not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this Reconcilation, but the Lord will continue thy friend ſtil. But yet if indeed thou beeſt Reconciled; God wil put this into thy heart, that when there is any failing in thee, thou wilt never be at quiet till thou comeſt to renue thy peace again. Thou mayeſt loſe the ſence of thy peace, but thou ſhalt never loſe thy peace indeed. And though we cannot ſpeak ſuch a truth as this is without fear, and trembling; becauſe it may coſt the hardening of many a ſoul, yet ſo willing is God that his people ſhal be Comforted, as that he will have this doctrine of Reconciliation publiſhed, though it coſt the damnation of many ſinners.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Yea, the Accuſations of the Devil againſt thee ſhal never provoke God, ſo as to turn enemy to thee again. There may be peace made between friend, and friend, but it may be there may be ſome whiſperers ſome tale-bearers, and make-bates, by a ſpirit of Jealouſie that may goe between them, and do abundance of miſcheif by their ſuggeſtions; but this cannot be between God and us. It is true, the Devil would be continually a make-bate
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46564:22"/> between God, and thy ſoul, and doth continually go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to accuſe the ſoul, and therefore he is called the Accuſer of the Brethren. But the peace that is made up between God, and a ſoul, through his Son, is ſo firme, and the friendſhip is ſo ſtable, as that the Lord ſhuts his Ears aganiſt all the accuſations that can be made againſt his friends. One intire friend cannot indure to hear ill of another. It is a ſigne that freindſhip begins to grow cold when they are willing to hear of any evill againſt their freind. The Lord will not liſten to the leaſt accuſation that is made by Satan againſt his friend, he will not ſo much as be willing to hear of any thing ſpoken againſt his people; ſuch a perfect, and through, and firm peace is there made between the ſoul, and God.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, hence followeth peace with al the Creatures in the world; whereas before, not only God was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but all the Creatures were enemies: the good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ill Creatures, thy Companions whom thou thoughteſt to be thy friends; the Heavens, the earth, the Beaſts in the field, the Stones in thy Houſe, they were all thy enemies, not the leaſt Creature in the world but was one of the Hoſt of God ready preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to avenge the quarrell of God upon thee. You are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46564:23"/> afraid of ſouldiers, why have you not all this while been afraid of the Hoſt of the Almighty God? God hath Souldiers enough, even in your own houſe which he can raiſe up againſt you; he can raiſe the very dog that is in your family to tear out your throat if he once give him a Commiſſion; for there is an enmity between every Creature, and a ſinful ſoul, and it muſt be ſo. If there be an enmity againſt the Generall, and Commander in chief of the Army, there muſt needs be then the like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt the ſouldiers. Thou that art a ſinful ſoul, thou walkeſt up and down in the midſt of Gods Hoſt that are ready every moment to deſtroy thee, and that ſtands waiting for a Commiſſion from God, the Lord of Hoſt to revenge his quarrell upon thee. But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once reconciled unto God, all this Hoſt, all the whol Creation is reconciled unto thee. All the good Creatures, the Angels they are now for thy good, whereas before they ſtood ready waiting for a Commiſſion from God to ſtrike thee to the heart, for the Angels do wait when God wil give them a command to execute upon thoſe that offend him, and they are gone peſently to put the ſame in execution; and ſo it is with every other Creature. But now being reconciled, theſe Angels are become miniſtring ſpirits unto thee. It is a great matter to have the Angels reconciled: by being at peace with God they come to be Reconciled alſo unto thee, and inſtead of being thy enemies, they are as ſo many fair chariots to guard thee from whatſoever may hurt thee. The ſame I may ſay of all evil Creatures too, they are al ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to thee, as that they ſhal do thee no hurt or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. But</p>

                  <p>Secondly: A Second fruit that follows, is, Peace of Conſcience, whereas before thy Conſcience terrified thee, ſtruck fear, and dread in thy heart, &amp; continually accuſed thee before God, and was as Gods Officer to fill thy Soul with poyſoned Arrows, and to rend and tear thee.

                  <head>Third Conſequence.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is in the ſoul a Peace in all other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. As thus: Before the work of Reconciliation between God and man was done, the Scripture ſaith, there is no Peace to the wicked in regard of tumultuous workings of the many luſts that are in their hearts, the one continally fighting againſt the other: the Conſcience telling one thing, and the will of a man that oppoſeth Conſcience; and the affections they are all in a tumult one againſt another; one luſt oppoſeth another, fighteth againſt another; there is a diſorder, and a confuſion, and a tumult in the heart of a wicked man, he goes againſt the light, and the light againſt him, and there is nothing but warring, and combuſtion in his heart: <hi>Your luſts</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>war one againſt another within you;</hi> and you may eaſily find it to be ſo if you obſerve your ſelves, that when your luſts are once up, they breed ſuch a woful diſturbance in your heart, that you are like the Sea that caſts up nothing but mire and dirt. Take a wicked man that hath but ſome darting in of any light, telling him what the mind of God is, his heart fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this light, and the light fights againſt his heart; ſo that there are nothing but woful diſturbances in his Soul, and he is never at Peace; No, not when he ſeems to be moſt ſerene and quiet. But now when we come to be at Peace wih God there is a bleſſed calme comes into the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46564:24"/> Spirit of a man, the Conſcience, the wil, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are brought into a ſweet, and Comly order, and things are in a great meaſure more quiet than ever they were.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Conſequence.</head>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth fruit is, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: for God being at Peace with a ſoul, the Holy Spirit comes, and ſheddeth abroad the love of God. It is true, ſomtimes we are not ſenſible of this joy, but when once we come to know that we are Reconciled unto God, then we come to feele the joy of the Holy Spirit ſhed abroad in our hearts. This you have in Rom. 5. <hi>Having Peace with God, we rejoyce in tribulation.</hi> And more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Rom. 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is nor meat, and drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit:</hi> Joy in the Holy Spirit followes our Peace, or our Reconciliation with God. That is a <hi>fourth particular.</hi>

                  <head>The fift Conſequence.</head>
                  <p n="5">5. There is likewiſe this fruit of it. Hence the ſoul comes to have free acceſs into Gods preſence with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Indeed when I look upon God as an enemy unto me, and upon my ſelf as an enemy unto God, how can I come into Gods preſence with boldneſs. But being Reconciled, I come to have acceſs to God. <hi>Adam</hi> could not ſtand in Gods preſence when once he had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Peace with God, but our Peace being made through Jeſus Chriſt, we may come into the preſence of God, and comfortably look upon his face, and ſee no hatred, no revenging wrath in it.</p>

But if once there come to be a League and a Peace made up between the one and the other, then
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46564:24"/> trade is open. So it is between God, and the ſoul. And the truth is, there is no free trade made between Heaven and us, till Peace be made, we cannot trade to Heaven, and fetch Commodities from thence, we may ſpeak to Heaven, and Cry, and ſay our Prayers (as the phraſe is) but to fetch from thence the rich Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that are in that Country, we cannot til there be a Peace Concluded. Indeed a gracious heart that is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, never ſends up a prayer unto God, but he doth as a rich man that ſendeth a Ship to the Indies, nay, it is far more &amp; better, for you may looſe your Ship, and your adventure that you ſend may miſcarry: But when a gracious ſoul trades with God, and ſendeth his Ship of prayer to Heaven, he never fails of having a ſweet and rich return.</p>

You wil ſay, Would any one be willing to be plundred? Truly, if you knew that there were the work of Gods wiſdom in it to you, and how it doth accompliſh his end, and work his glory, if you loved God, you would willingly give up your ſelves, and your eſtates unto him, and ſay, it is better for me to give up al that I have when it may be for the glory of God, though I cannot tel the particular way, yet I know God wil have his glory by it, than it is for me ſtil to retain the poſſeſſion thereof. Therefore the Saints of God have nothing taken away from them, but what is by warrant from God; and from God that is my friend, and remains my friend. We do not underſtand the vaſtneſs of Gods love, if we do not think that Gods intire love can ſtand with ſuch a work, as taking away ſome of our eſtate: Gods love is ſo vaſt, as it can ſtand with a thouſand ſuch things as that is.

                  <p n="11">11. That by our Peace, and with our Peace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wrath of God, whatſoever Judgments of God comes abroad, or are executed in the world, we come to be freed from the evil of them, ſo that none of that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46564:26"/> wrath ſhal befal us, not in any revenging way, as it doth befal wicked and ungodly men, but we ſhal Certainly be delivered from all the evil of it. When judgments are ſent from heaven abroad into the world, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection unto al thoſe that are Reconciled unto God, though there be darkneſs every where elſe, yet there is light in their hearts, they are alwaies in <hi>Goſhan,</hi> though God be never ſo terrible in his judgments unto others, yet this terror of God is taken from them. If you ſhould hear the noiſe of Trumpets, and Drums, the neighing of Horſes, the roaring of Cannons, and ſhooting of Muskets, and all the dreadful ſound of warlike inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: peradventure at the firſt it may ſtrike ſome feare and terror into you, but when you come to hear, that al comes from your friend, it takes away the terror of al theſe things. If a man comes to a houſe where there are a Company of fierce maſtive Dogs that are barking as if they would come preſenly and tear out his throat, he may happily be in ſome fear; but if the maſter of the houſe be his friend, and if he ſtand by, he need not then fear that any hurt ſhal come to him by them. It is true indeed, if he be an enemy, or if he be a Thief, that comes to ſteal, and deſtroy he may fear theſe maſtives. So, the Troubles of the world, may come with open mouth, as if they would devour us, but if we be Gods friends, if he ſtand by, we need not fear what they can do to us, for we have a <hi>quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt,</hi> we have a protection from God from all the evils that are in the world. Though the devouring Angel ſhal come to deſtroy, yet (if the blood of Chriſt who is our Peace be ſprinkled upon the poſts of the doors of our hearts) this Angel ſhall paſs away from us. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit of our Peace with God; namely, protection from the wrath of God when it ſpreads abroad as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the world.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. Again: Hence all that is in Gods word ſpeaks Peace to us, both the Law, and the Goſpel; the very
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46564:26"/> Law it ſelf comes to ſpeak Peace to us becauſe it is now fully ſatisfied; there is nothing in the word of God, but is at Peace with thoſe that are at Peace with him. The threats that are in the word of God bring no evill at all to him that is reconciled to God, every part of Gods word doth do good to them that walk uprightly, according to that in <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> When thou readeſt any part of the word of God though never ſo terrible, if thou art Reconciled to God, thou mayeſt read it with comfort. Many people dare not read ſomwhat of Gods word; they ſcarce dare come to hear ſomwhat of Gods word, but if thou beeſt at peace with God, thou needeſt not fear the reading, or the hearing of any part of Gods word. What is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that many people when there is an argument preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that hath any terror in it, they will come no more to hear it? It is, whatſoevever their pretences be, a ſign that there is ſome guilt in their hearts, they look upon the word of God as if it were their enemy; and it is a ſad thing for a man to look upon any part of Gods word as his enemy; Certainly if any part of Gods word be thy enemy, God is thy enemy, for there is no part of the word of God, but there is Gods mind, and Gods heart in it, and therefore if thou beeſt at peace with God, there is nothing in that word of God which is thine enemy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a man that is on the Sea, if ſtorms, and Tempeſts ariſe: he may peradventure be afraid to look out, he may not dare to ſtir out of his Cabbin: But if he be on ſhore, he can ſtand, and look upon all the waves of the Sea, and upon all the boyſterouſneſſe of it without any trouble to him. So, when men are in their natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when they are not converted unto God; then when they come to hear of the terrors of the Law, alas they cannot enter into Conſideration of that wrath of God which the Law threatneth, and which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend is due unto them becauſe of ſin, but their very hearts ſhake, &amp; they do even ſhut their eyes againſt thoſe truths.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46564:27"/> But when they are once got upon the ſhore, when there is a Peace made between God and them, then they may look upon al the terrors of the Law, and upon al that wrath that is threatned therein, with joy and Comfort, and bleſs the name of God for ever that they are freed and delivered from them. Theſe are the bleſſed, and happy fruits of our Peace, and Reconciliation with God. And now before we go any further, we muſt abide a while in the Application of what hath been thus far opened unto you concerning the excellencies, and glorious fruits of this Peace and Reconciliation.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore in the firſt Place: From hence it muſt needs follow, that if there be ſuch a bleſſed peace between God, and a true Chriſtian as hath been opened: Then he muſt needs be very peaceable in the world, he muſt needs be of a very peaceable diſpoſition before men. You wil ſay, How doth this follow? Thus. There is ſo much ſweeteneſs in this Peace with God that it muſt needs ſo quiet the ſpirit of that man in whom it is, that whatſoever is without ſhal never be able to make any great diſturbance in his Spirit, ſo great, and ſo excellent is the ſweetneſs of this Peace. A Merchant that hath al his eſtate in one Bottom, he is upon every ſtirring of the winds, or upon the hearing of any ſtorme, afraid that all is caſt away. But if he hear news, that the Ship is ſafe, and that al is come ſecurely into the Haven, his Spirit that was afraid before, wil be now ſo quieted, and ſattisfied with this newes, that it wil not be a very eaſie matter at ſuch a time to anger ſuch a man. There is nothing that is more able to keep the heart of a man from paſſion, and frowardneſs, and diſturbance, than a ful ſattisfaction within ones own ſpirit. Now, if there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46564:27"/> be any thing in the world that is able to ſattisfy the ſpirit of a man; ſurely it is the Peace with God, it is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation which is made between a man, and God. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>that a good man ſhal be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from himſelf. Prov.</hi> 14.14.<note place="margin">Ex ſeſe, at <hi>Mercerus,</hi> expreſſeth it, i. e. from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he meeteth with thoſe without that are troubleſome, and wil not ſattisfy him, that he hath ſo much within, that he ſattis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and quieteth his own ſpirit: Therefore a Chriſtian needs not be beholding to the world for Peace, for he hath Peace enough within his own boſome. That which is the greateſt Jewel in the world, a Chriſtian hath the ful pofeſſion of within his own heart. Al the Storms, and tempeſts that are abroad in the world can never make an Earthquake if there be not ſome vapors within to do it. So, that which doth ſhake the hearts of men, and make a Combuſtion in their Spirits, it is more the inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances that are there, than any thing from without. We may Complaine of outward things, and of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of this occaſion, and the like; But the truth is, if al be examined, and the true ground of our diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſearched into, we ſhal find, that the Cauſe of al our diſturbance is rather from within, than from without; and if al were wel within, we ſhould never be troubled with any thing which doth befal us from without. Now then if any thing in the world wil make al quiet within, if any thing in the world wil beget a ſerenity, and Calmneſs in the ſpirits of men, it is this Reconciliation with God. No marvel then that the Goſpel ſpeakes ſo much of the peaceable diſpoſition of thoſe that entertaine it, that it tells us of the Wolſes dwelling with the Lamb, of the Lyons eating ſtraw with the Oxe, that is, though men were formerly of ſuch Wolfiſh, and Lyon-like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet having received the Goſpel, and accepted of the tearmes of Reconciliation with God, they ſhal be as Lambs, they ſhal agree one with another. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe there is ſo much in the Peace of the Goſpel as wil quiet the heart, ſo that a man may wonder when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46564:28"/> he Conſiders of the excellency of the Peace that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, how it is poſſible for a Chriſtian to be put into a paſſion? You Complaine of the troubles you meet withal in your world, that your Husband is froward, or that the Wife is froward, that you have perverſe Neighbours; but, is God at Peace with thee? is not he froward towards thee? and ſhal your ſpirits be diſturbed with thoſe things when you are at Peace with God? is there not enough in this peace to ſwallow up all thoſe diſturbances? I have obſerved, that it is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent complaint of thoſe that are taken to be godly men, they wil ſay, ſuch a one is a very good man, but he is very paſſionate, and froward: truly it is a an extream blot to profeſſors: and the truth is, if we duly conſider all things, a man would think there ſhould be nothing more oppoſite to the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, than froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and paſſion is, nothing more oppoſite to true grace; for when grace comes, when Faith in Chriſt comes, it breedeth ſuch abundance of peace in our hearts, that one would think that frowardneſs, and paſſion with any in the world ſhould be inconſiſtent with the Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here ſpoken of, with true grace, and with Faith in Chriſt. When men are of ſuch ſpirits that they are ſoon put into a paſſion, and being in a paſſion cannot be Reconciled, it is a dangerous ſign that there is not that peace made between God and your ſouls that you ſpeake of. And Certainly this is the reaſon why many Chriſtians are ſo paſſionate as they are, becauſe they do not maintain their peace with God: there is uſually ſome breach in their peace with God which makes them ſo froward, and ſo paſsionate as they are with men. And to ſhew, that the more our peace with God is broken, the more froward wil our ſpirits be. You have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example for that in <hi>Saul; Saul</hi> when he came firſt to the Crown, he ſeemed to be of a very low, and meek ſpirit, he counteth his family to be the leaſt of the Tribes, and himſelf to be of the leaſt of that family. And when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46564:28"/> there were ſome Children of <hi>Belial</hi> that ſpaek againſt him, and ſaid, Shal this man be King over us? The ſcripture tels us that he held his peace: and when ſome would have had thoſe that ſpake againſt him before to be put to death, no, ſaith <hi>Saul,</hi> there ſhal not any man be put to death this day. At firſt you ſee <hi>Saul</hi> was of a quiet ſpirit, of a very meek diſpoſition, but after <hi>Saul</hi> had departed from God, and God was departed from him, he was then of a very froward, and ſurly, and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and harſh diſpoſition, and he that was before of a peaceable, and quiet diſpoſition to his enemies, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was of a froward, and croſs diſpoſition, even to his own Son, to <hi>Jonathan</hi> who was a good Son, a gracious, and godly Son, a Son of a ſweet nature, and yet even to him, how harſh was he, O thou child of a perverſe woman ſaith he, and he would have ſlaine him in that pasſion, if the people had not prevented him. And how froward was he likewiſe when he was but croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of his wil, when he heard that the Prieſts had but let <hi>David</hi> paſs away with ſome ſmal ſupplies, they muſt be al put to death, man, woman, and Child, and fourſcore and five of the Prieſts of the Lord that wore a ſinnen Ephod muſt al be preſently murdred, ſuch a froward, croſs, rugged, and harſh nature was <hi>Saul</hi> of, and what was the reaſon of this? Becauſe he had depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, and God was departed from him. You therefore that are of froward, and pasſionate Spirits, have cauſe to look into your own hearts, and examine your ſelves wel whether this be not the ground of it, even that you have broke your peace with God, and now you are at peace with no body, not with Husband, nor with Wife, nor with Neighbors, whereas if you did keep cloſe with God, and maintained but the ſweetneſs of your hearts in the injoyment of peace with him, it would not be eaſy for you to be diſturbed with any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals you from without. This is the firſt thing that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth from the ſweetneſs of our Reconciliation with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46564:29"/> God, that a gracious heart who knows what that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, muſt needs be of a ſweet, and lovely, and meek diſpoſition towards others.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, O! the bleſſed eſtate of a Beleever, of one that hath imbraced the Goſpel, he is Reconciled to God, he is at peace with God, and that hath a great deal in it as you have have heard. The Jews were wont to expreſſe all kind of proſperity, and happpineſſe by this word <hi>[Peace] Peace be to you;</hi> and in ſaying ſo, they did wiſh all manner of good; for indeed the word is a comprehenſive word; and therefore God accounteth it his glory, to be called the God of Peace; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God of Peace, &amp;c. And the Son of God, it is his glory to be the Prince of Peace. And the ſpirit of God, it is his glory to have the fruits of the ſpirit to be Joy, and Peace. And it is the honor of the Goſpel, to be the Goſpel of Peace. And it is the glory of the Kingdom of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in righteouſneſſe, and Peace. And it is the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical benediction; Grace, &amp; peace, It is the glory of the Covenant of Life, to be a Covenant of Peace. Peace, it is a moſt amiable thing; But Peace with God, how lovely, and amiable, and glorious is it? Ask a wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that apprehends, and is ſenſible of that enmity that ſin hath put between God, and it, what it would give for peace with God? Ask, Ask a dying man that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends what God is, one who hath no peace with God, what he would give for Peace with God? If you could poſſibly ask thoſe damned ſpirits that are now in Hell, what they think of peace with God? O! what a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation would they ſet on this peace! Well may we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46564:29"/> be willing to endure ſome trouble in ſeeking after this peace with God: well may we be contented to lie under the ſtroak of the Law as long as God pleaſeth, for this peace wil at laſt make up all. Thoſe that have endured the greateſt terrors of the Law, when the Lord hath come in with manifeſtations of this peace, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to them in Jeſus Chriſt, they have thought all well recompenced; and if it had been to endure a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more than they have done, they would have thought all to have been made up in this bleſſed peace. This is a bleſſing indeed in theſe troubleſom times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we hear of nothing but of wars and of rumors of wars, and we are taught by what we now hear, and feel, and know, to prize outward peace. But if we think out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace be ſo great a mercy, what is this Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and peace with God, the Soul bleſſings.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wil ſay, there is a great deal of Bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this Reconciliation with God which we have read of, and happy is the ſoul that is at peace with him. But how ſhal we know that we are thoſe that are Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, that ſo we may injoy thoſe bleſſed fruits of Reconciliacion, that is here treated of? I confeſſe, this is worth the knowing, and worth the ſearching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is a good ſign if your hearts be ſeriouſly inquiſitive to know how tearms ſtand between God and your ſouls: and this is a thing that doth not uſually take up the thoughts of men, and perhaps there are many that ſcarce in all the daies of their lives had their thoughts ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſly taken up with this, to conſider, how do the tearms ſtand between God and my ſoul? I here go up and down in the world, and buſie my ſelf about this, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, But O! my ſoul, how doth things ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and you? are all things wel there? are all things quiet there? hath not God ſomthing againſt you? hath not God dreadful things to charge upon you? Yea, you wil ſay, God hath enough to charg upon us all. No, but if thou be at peace with God in Chriſt, God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46564:30"/> hath nothing to charge thee withal. And it is poſſible for one to be in ſuch a Condition, as to know that God hath nothing to charge him with, and ſo he may be able to ſtand before the Lord, as freed from any thing that God hath to lay to his charge. This might be manifeſted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the excellency of our peace with God. It is true, none can be in ſuch a condition but that they have ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in themſelves to be charged upon them if God look upon them in themſelves; and thoſe ſolus that charge themſelves moſt, thoſe uſually God hath leaſt to charge upon. In themſelves I affirm, God hath enough againſt them; but God looking upon them in Jeſus Chriſt, he hath nothing to charge them withal, ſo as that they ſhould ſtand guilty in his preſence, or be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his Law which they have broken. You wil ſay, How then can God afflict for ſin? Yes, there is no ſuch conſequence, that becauſe men have nothing to anſwer unto the Law, therefore they are not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, for afflictions to thoſe that are Reconciled to God, are not fruits of the Law, but they are diſpenſations of God in his waies of wiſdom to his people; becauſe he thinks that afflictions are a fit way to manifeſt unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to the world that he is a holy God, and that he is diſpleaſed with ſin, and God wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s upon them in ſuch a way, but not as in a way of giving ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, that is not Gods end in afflicting of them. There is a great deal of difference between a fatherly diſpleaſure, and a revenging diſpleaſure; God hath ſwallowed up in this Reconciliation, all the diſpleaſure of a Judge, all his revenging diſpleaſure; and he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly ſwallowed it up, but yet there may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the other, he hath not ſwallowed up his fatherly diſpleaſure, but retains it, and that without any dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to himſelf, all tending to the good of thoſe that the Lord manifeſteth ſuch diſpleaſure againſt.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Certainly, except thou haſt layed down al thy weapons of war, and enmity againſt God, thou art not yet at peace with him. And canſt thou in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of thy heart appeal thus unto God? Lord, thou knoweſt there's no weapon of enmity againſt thee in my heart that ever I have taken notice of, but I have been willing, and ſhal be willing to lay it down, and God forbid that ever there ſhould be the leaſt weapon of warr found in my heart againſt God. Every known ſin in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46564:31"/> thee is a weapon of warfare againſt God, and though thou ſhould'ſt lay down many, yet if that be not layed down; if thou keepeſt any one known ſin within thee, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that one ſin is enough to make an eternal breach, and enmity between God, and thy ſoul. Now, be not at quiet, be not at reſt in thy own ſpirit, do not ſleep quietly this night, except thou canſt bring thy heart to this, that thou canſt go in ſecret between God and thy ſelf, and ſay; O Lord, thou knoweſt I have renounced al the waies of ſins that ever thou haſt revealed to me, though my ſins do cleave to me as cloſe as my skin to my fleſh, yet as ſoon as I take notice of them, as ſoon as thou makeſt them known unto me; I cry out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine againſt them. As ſuppoſe in time of war, ſome come into your houſes, and you know not at their firſt coming who they are: but are afterward by their Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and behavior, and by their ſpeech you come to take notice that they are of your enemies: Now it after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of them, you ſhal make much of them, and Cherriſh them, and entertain them, and ſupply their wants, give them Money, or Plate, or what elſe you have, you wil be found to be an enemy to the State. But if as ſoon as you take notice of them, you deſire them to be gone, and you do what you can to thruſt them out of your doores; and if they be too ſtrong for you, you go and complayne to your neighbour, or to the Officers that are about you, and you deſire them to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you ſome ſtrength to apprehend them, this cannot be charged upon you, that you are an enemy to the ſtate, why? Becauſe though they be in your houſe, yet it is ful ſore againſt your wills. And ſo, many men, though they entertain their Corruptions, and Cherriſh them, and fulfil the luſts of them, they think to put it off with this, what wil you have me to do? I cannot help it: But do you complaine of it? do you cry out unto God, and ſay, Lord here is an enemy, an enemy to thee, as wel as unto my ſelf? an enemy to thy glory, as wel as to my
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46564:31"/> own ſoul; O that thou would'ſt come in and caſt this enemy of mine &amp; thine out of my heart, I cannot ſleep quiet, I cannot reſt, and be at peace ſo long as this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is within me, till thou comeſt and caſt it out. This is a ſign that thou art at peace with God, if thou haſt laid down thy weapons of warfare againſt God, and art at enmity with every ſin: If thou entertaineſt in thy boſom no known ſin, though never ſo ſecret. And this is the moſt eminent ſign that can be, ſo that the weakeſt Chriſtian may be able to apply it to himſelf, and come to know ſomewhat about this peace with God.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If thou wouldſt know whether God, and thee be reconciled, then let me put this to thee: What Treaties have there been made between God, and thy Soul? for this you muſt know, that though there may be a Peace indeed made between God and thee, in ſome kind even from eternity (as I ſhall afterwards ſhew you) yet before it come into thy heart, before thou can'ſt come to know it, there muſt a Treaty paſs between God, and thee. Reonciliation that is from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity comes from Treaties between God the father, and God the Son, and that Reconciliation that in time comes into the Conſcience, is a fruit of ſome Treaty that hath been between God, and thy ſelf. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: When God would be at peace with a Soul, he ſummons that Soul to come in, he tels it that it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to him, and that he is going on in contrary waies to him. As uſually you know when enemies come to a Town, they will firſt ſummon the Town before they ſtorm it: So the Lord ſummons thee to come in. When did God ever ſummon thy heart? Haſt thou felt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Gods ſummons in thy ſoul? Then again: Haſt thou felt much intercourſe between God and thy Soul? Hath God been ſpeaking to thy heart, and thy heart ſpeaking unto God? Hath God been working towards thee, and hath thy heart been working towards God? Hath the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46564:32"/> Lord ſent unto thee by his word, and haſt thou ſent up unto him by prayer, and as the Lord waits upon thee to know what thy anſwer is when he ſpeaks to thee: So, do'ſt thou wait upon him to know his anſwer when thou prayeſt, What have been the Treaties that have paſſed ſecretly in thy cloſet between God and thy Soul? Thou doſt not go on in a dul way, and come and hear the word of God, but never hear the voice of God, but when thou comeſt to hear Gods word, thou heareſt Gods voyce, thou heareſt him ſpeak unto thee, Treating with thee about matters of Peace, and thou feeleſt Gods Spirit drawing thy heart, and telling ſomewhat of Gods mind unto thee: perhaps at this time, and for the preſent whileſt thou art hearing, thou telleſt God ſecretly by ejaculations. Lord I am willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thoſe tearms of Peace, and Reconciliation; <hi>I</hi> am willing to accept of the Conditions of the Covenant. Or perhaps when thou doeſt not this when thou art hearing, yet when thou art got alone, then thou openeſt thy ſelf more unto God, and ſendeſt a ful anſwer unto God. This is the way of treating, that when thou comeſt to hear Gods word offering tearms of peace, and require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, and ſuch tearmes, thou at the very hearing ſendeſt up by ejaculations ſecretly in anſwer to God, Lord, I accept of the tearms, and when thou art gone, ſendeſt up a ful anſwer, and then how doeſt thou bleſs his name that ever he was pleaſed to offer ſuch tearms unto thee, though they were a thouſand times harder. Hath there ever been any ſuch doings in thy heart? hath it been one of the greateſt works that ever thy heart hath been ſet upon? hath thy heart been ſet more upon this work of the treaty with God about peace, than about any thing that ever concerned thee in al thy life? Then it is a good evidence unto thee that thou art in a way of Peace, and if thy Conſcience ſpeaks peace unto thee from this, it wil be a comfortable evidence indeed. But the truth is <hi>I</hi> cannot give you the ful, and through evidence, ſo as fully to ſattisfy your heart til I come to the next point.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46564:32"/> To ſhew you how the heart is brought to Chriſt and reconciled to God in him. But ſomewhat may be done to help the ſoul that way.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the Third Signe therefore is this. If thou beeſt at peace with God, then upon Gods being pacified towards thee, and upon thy apprehenſion of it, it wil make thee looke back to thy former wretched dealings with God, and be confounded in thy own thoughts, and cauſe thee even to abhor thy ſelf for that curſed carriage of thy heart towards him, and dealings with him when thou wert in away of oppoſition, and when thou wert walking Contrary to him. I wil give you a moſt excellent ſcripture for that: it is in the 16. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> the latter end. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember and be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and never open thy mouth any more;</hi> Why? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done;</hi> that is the time you ſee when the ſoul comes to be aſhamed of its wretched dealings with God, and be confounded in the thought thereof, even when the Lord is pacified towards it for al the evil that it hath done towards him. Lay this therefore, (when you lay aſide this Book and are got alone,) warm to hearts. A man would think, if God ſhould aske the queſtion, that this ſhould rather be anſwered when God comes, and reveales the fruits of this wrath towards a ſoul, no, but when I am pacified, (ſaith God) towards thee; then thou ſhalt be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more. So that if thou haſt any evidence, any found evidence to thy ſoul that the Lord is pacified towards thee for al the evil that thou haſt done againſt him, it wil make thee look back to thy former actings, and when thou doſt remember them thou wilt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in thy own thoughts, and whatſoever God doth do with thee, thou wilt never open thy mouth any more but be aſhamed of thy ſelf for al thy wicked dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Many of your Conſciences may tel you that there hath been divers horrible things acted by you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46564:33"/> the Lord, what ſins have not many of you lived in? do you hope that God is reconciled to you, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified towards you for al thoſe horrible things that you have done? If he be, you wil upon this grace of God towards you, look back upon what you have done formerly, and be confounded in your own ſouls, and the mroe you apprehend your peace to be made with God, the more wil you be aſhamed, and the more wil you be troubled for what you have done. Many a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinner that hath lived in waies of ſin, when the fear of death comes upon him wil be confounded &amp; aſhamed of what he hath done; &amp; then he wil complain, &amp; cry out to others, and deſire them to pray for him; but that is not the thing that God here ſpeaks of, for let God but ſet ſuch a one upon his feet again, and free him from his ſickneſs, and fears, he is no longer confounded, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, but wil be as jolly, and as merry as before. But if God indeed be pacified towards thy ſoul, thou wilt then be confounded, and aſhamed for all the evils that thou haſt done againſt him. This is as comfortable an argument that peace is made betwixt God, and us, and that he is reconciled towards us, as any I know, when upon the apprehenſion of that peace and Reconciliation we come to be confounded in our own Souls.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, He that is at Peace with God, doth ſet a mighty high eſteme upon that peace, he wil not eaſily part with it, he wil not eaſily loſe it, that is the Bird in the boſom that he deſires to keep ſinging, whatſoever becomes of him, ſo long as he can keep that Bird ſinging in his breſt, he thinks himſelf wel enough, though he ſhould meet with never ſo many difficulties, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in the waies of God. One that hath got this peace with God knows how to priſe it, for the truth is, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, it is gotten with a great deal of difficulty, it coſt them ſomewhat, and it coſt Jeſus Chriſt ſomwhat before they could get it. Haſt thou got peace with God? if it be of the right ſtamp, know, it coſt thee dear, and it coſt Jeſus Chriſt dear, and ſurely now thou haſt it, it wil be dear likewiſe to thy ſoul: So that if Sin ſhould preſent it ſelf to thee, and goe about to withdraw thy heart from God unto that which is evil, this wil be the very thought of thy heart (though perhaps there may be pleaſure and profit in the way which ſin preſents to thee) this wil be the very thought of thy heart, Wil it not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my peace with God? If there be the leaſt ſuſpition of that, away with it ſaith the ſoul, I wil not buy the pleaſure, or the profit of ſin at ſo dear a rate. It ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin as the Figg Tree, and Olive Tree, ſaid unto the other Trees when they would come and perſwade them to rule over them. Shal I loſe my ſweetneſs ſaith the Figg Tree, and my fattneſs ſaith the Olive Tree, to come and be King over you?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46564:34"/> to it, ſhal I loſe my ſweetenſs, and my fatneſs? ſhal I loſe that bleſſed quietude that is between God and me, to come, and cloſe with you? O, God forbid, ſurely, I wil never buy the ſweet of Sin at ſuch a dear rate. It is true indeed, the men of the world who have a falſe peace, wil venture that peace upon any light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. If a man have a Jewel that is but a falſe Jewel, ſuch a thing as a Briſtoll ſtone is, that it may be is not worth two pence, he wil not be much careful of it. But if he have a Jewel that is a true Diamond or that is a right Pearl, he wil not venture that upon a little matter. The Peace that moſt men have, is a counterfeit falſe Peace and they wil ſoon venture it upon any tearms. Theſe men that can ſo readily yield to the Temptations of ſin; it is an evident argument, that the Peace they have is but a falſe peace, and that is the reaſon they can part with it upon ſuch eaſie conditions. But the ſoul that hath true peace with God, looks upon it as a Jewel of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable value, as a precious Pearl: Here is my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaith he, you ſhall not have this away from me with a whiſtle, with a light matter, I will not part with this ſo, which coſt me ſo dear, and which coſt Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſo dear, no leſs than his own blood. Moſt people in the world think they have peace with God, but let me ask, what did your peace coſt you? It coſt little, and ſo lightly come lightly go: that is the reaſon of al your looſe profeſſors that walk ſo careleſly in their waies, the peace they have had comes lightly to them, and ſo goes lightly away from them, they have patched to themſelves a peace, but they have not the right underſtanding of the myſtery of the ſouls Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God, and that is the very ground of the looſeneſs of their converſations.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavoured to help you to examine your peace whether it be true, or no. If you can upon theſe ſignes, or notes conclude your peace to be right; Bleſſed are you, go your waies rejoycing, and joyn with

There is an excellent Scripture in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5. That hath ſome difficulty for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, but it is very ſweet if rightly underſtood. <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength that he may make peace with me, and he ſhal make Peace with me:</hi> it is a ſtrange kind of Phraſe, and I find a great deal of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence amongſt Interpreters about this text. I find Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> that uſually hits as right as moſt, carrying of it by way of interogation, and ſo he ſaith you may read it thus. <hi>Wil he take hold of my ſtrength that he may make peace with me?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, what wil he do? wil he ſtay ſo long till he come to be made ſenſible of my power upon him, and of my ſtrength to bring him down? and then it may be he wil make peace with me. Thus many do, they ſtay til God comes to make them ſenſible of his power, and of his ſtrength, and then they wil make their peace with God. But I can hardly think this to be the ſcope, only it is a very good meditation to ſet God before you in his power, &amp; in his ſtrength, &amp; in his glory, and to meditate with your ſelves thus: O, if the Lord ſhould come now, and make me apprehenſive, and ſenſible of that power, and ſtrength of his, indeed this wil ſtir up my heart to ſeek to make my peace with him. What is the reaſon that there comes ſo many ſhreiks, and cryings from ſouls when they are ſenſible of Gods power, and ſtrength? O! they well know what a mighty God they have to do withal: the truth is the reaſon why men do not make it their work now to ſeek Reconciliation and peace with God; it is becauſe they are not apprehenſive of the power, and majeſty, and glory that is in God, how God is above them, and can bring them under, and make them vile, and baſe when he pleaſeth. Therefore it is a good interpretation of the words, Wil he take hold, or apprehend my ſtrength,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46564:36"/> (ſo the word ſignifies) that he may make peace with me? But to me, the meaning is rather this, <hi>wil he rather make uſe of my goodneſs, and my mercy, and ſo make peace with me?</hi> For that is the ſtrength that is here meant, and that I ſhal ſhew you from the dependance; only firſt let me tel you, that in Scripture <hi>[Strength]</hi> is often uſed for Gods goodneſs, and mercy, his power to do good, as wel as his power to inflict miſery, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I wil give you but a ſcripture or two for that. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And now</hi> I <hi>beſeech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, ſaying, the Lord is of long Suffering, &amp; of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and trangreſſion, &amp;c.</hi> And in verſ, 19. <hi>Pardon</hi> I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> is pleading with God for a pacification between him and his people, he makes uſe of Gods power, O Lord (ſaith he) according to the greatneſs of thy power, or according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy ſtrength (for it is all one) do this. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>The Lord is the ſtrength of my life;</hi> where Gods power, and ſtrength are tearmes uſed to ſet out the way of God towards <hi>David.</hi> And here the word doth ſignifie ſuch a kind of ſtrength as is to help a thing that is very weak, that as the Vine being very weak, and being left to itſelf, fals down, and therefore you uſe to put props under your Vines which have more ſtrength in them than the Vines have in themſelves to keep them up, and that is the very word in the Original which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>[Strength]</hi> as if God ſhould have ſaid, wil he take hold on me, as on a prop? And that this is the meaning of it, appeares by the dependence of the words, for the Prophet in that Chapter was ſpeaking of the goodneſs of God to his Vinyard, verſ. 2. <hi>In that day Sing you unto her a Vinyard of Red wine,</hi> I <hi>the Lord do keep it,</hi> I <hi>wil water it every moment, leaſt any hurt it,</hi> I <hi>wil keep it night and day:</hi> what a ſweet promiſe is this of God to his Church: Are there a great many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46564:37"/> abroad that are ſtrong and powerful, and of ſwift feet, ready to ſhed blood? mark, in one verſe you ſhal read three <hi>I</hi>'s, I, I, I, ſaith God; I oppoſe my ſelf to al the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of my Church: I do keep it, I wil water it every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I wil keep it: but what ſhal become of it in the night? I wil keep it ſaith he, night and day. We have here a promiſe to help us to ſleep quietly. Wel, he goes on, verſe 4. <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> though it is true, I may come againſt you in ſuch waies that you may think I am provoked, but ſaith he, fuiry is not in me, I am not provoked in a revenging way towards my people. <hi>Who would ſet the Briers, and Thorns againſt me in Battail?</hi> there are a Company of wicked and ungodly men that may ſet themſelves againſt me like Briers, and Thorns; But ſaith he, I <hi>wil go through them</hi> if they come in my way, I wil conſume them, <hi>I wil burn them together.</hi> But my people, they are my Vinyard, I wil deal gently with them, I wil be a prop, and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to them. And then he comes in with this, <hi>let them take hold of my ſtrength that they may make peace with me:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, you are pore weak creatures, you are indeed my Vinyard, and my Vine, but you are weak, and when a ſtorm comes, you are ready to bow down, and ly quaſh upon the ground; yea, but ſaith God, though you think that my wrath is abroad in the world, yet my power and my wrath is againſt mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and al my power, and my ſtrength, are for you, it is no otherwiſe but as the ſeting of a prop under a Vine in a time of tempeſt when a ſtorme would beat the Vine to the ground, my power ſhal be ſet under to keep it up. Now you ſhould (ſaith he) take hold of this my ſtrength, as the Vine claſpeth about the prop, and ſo make peace with me. This is an excellent text to put you on in theſe dangerous times to be ſure to make peace with God. You that are godly, and have ſome hopes that God is at peace with you, it may be you are troubled with fears of danger, know that God puts under his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46564:37"/> power, and his ſtrength, and he would have you take hold of it, take hold of my ſtrength ſaith he, even as the Vine takes hold of the prop, and ſo by renewing the act of Faith upon my power, and goodneſs, thereby you ſhal renew your peace with me, that whatſoever fury is abroad to burn the Briers, and Thorns, yet you ſhal have peace with me, and that power of mine that is put forth to deſtroy them, ſhal be a prop to uphold you. So that this Scripture, as it makes much for the openning of what I ſaid before, ſo it ſeems to put you on to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring, and indeavouring to make your peace with God in troubleſome times.

                  <p>In your making your peace with God, obſerve this rule: <hi>To reſolve with your own hearts, that you wil never be at peace with your ſelves til you be at peace with God,</hi> that you wil never have any peace in your own hearts, til you have gotten true peace with God. I do not ſay, that you ſhould reſolve never to have peace with others, but I ſay, reſolve never to be at peace with your ſelves: and it is a good controverſy when men are at contention with their evil hearts. Say within your ſelves, ſhal I be at peace with this wretched heart that is an enemy unto God? God forbid, this heart of mine ſhal be brought down, and be at peace with God before ever I wil be at peace with it. It is that which deſtroyes many a ſoul, that they are ſo indulgent to their own hearts, they are loth to fal out with them. And the truth is, many keep on in waies of enmity againſt God, becauſe they are loth to fal out with their own hearts, we ſhould be willing our hearts ſhould be troubled al our dayes, that the foundation of our peace, and quiet

                  <p>And then another way is this. Come in before God, even with a Rope about thy neck, and with Sackcloath upon thy loynes, caſt thy ſelf down before the Lord, <hi>and beſeech him to write his own tearms, give up thy heart unto God as it were a Blanck, and pray the Lord to write his own Conditions, only that God might be at peace with thee.</hi> And if thou do'ſt ſo indeed, then manifeſt the truth of it thus. That if afterwards any temptation to any ſin comes, or if thou beeſt caſt upon any duty, and findeſt thy heart backward thereto, make uſe then of the diſpoſition of thy heart: think thus: Was there not a time when I did ſeek to make my peace with God? was there not a time when I did caſt my ſelf before the Lord, and did then give up my ſelf as a blank to God, and intreated him to write his own conditions? and now God requires this duty of me, and I am loth to come to it, O, I do not do now ſo as I ſaid I would do when I was ſeeking for peace. Here is ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin; O how oppoſite is this to that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to God when I gave up my heart unto him. My Bretheren, I put this to you, either you have come into Gods preſence, and as poor humbled ſouls have given up your hearts to God as Blanks for him to write his own tearms upon; or you have not: If you have not; then you are not at peace with God, and ſo you may go away aſſured that you have nor done that great work which concerns you ten thouſand times more than your breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Ayre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But you wil ſay, I hope I have done this, I have been in my Cloſet giving up my heart as a Blank to God to write what Conditions he pleaſeth, and</hi> I <hi>have profeſſed to yield unto any tearms.</hi>

Either this muſt be done, or elſe you take Gods name in vaine.

You have a precious Scripture in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Wherefore Beloved ſeeing we look for ſuch things, be diligent that you be found of him in Peace.</hi> Do you not beleeve that there wil be a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the glorious God one day in another manner than ever he was manifeſted here in the world? Do you not look for ſuch things? If you do, certainly you will be glad to be at peace with God, <hi>Seeing you look for ſuch things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be diligent that you may be found of him in Peace;</hi> let this take up your thoughts as the greateſt buſineſs that your hearts can be ſet upon, that you may be found of him in peace. Woe be to you if you be then found enemies to God; what wil become of you, if you be not found of him in peace? it had been better for you, that you had never been born. But how found of him in peace? mark what follows,

                     <hi>without ſpot and blameleſs;</hi> this is the way to be at peace with God. But you will ſay, O Lord, if this be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a way to be found of him in peace, that we ſhould be without ſpot, and blameleſs, then we are undone, for who can be found of God without ſpot, and blameleſs? Yet you ſee, this is the word of God, and this is the truth of God, and truth muſt ſtand, it is a certain truth, that whoſoever ſhal be found of God in peace when that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearance of his ſhal be, he muſt be without ſpot, &amp; blameleſs. If God find any one ſpot upon you, he wil proceed againſt you as an enemy. But you will ſay, How is that? Firſt in Chriſt, there the ſoul ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord without ſpot, cleer in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and likewiſe Evangelically it may be found ſo in Gods eſteem, for God cals the uprightneſs of a mans heart perfection in other Scriptures. <hi>Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect, and let us perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> God looks ſo upon it, becauſe God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth al in Chriſt, &amp; accepteth of beleevers in Chriſt; &amp; ſo they are peſented before him ſpotleſs, and blameleſs, and he gives them a heart too, to endeavor to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ſpot, and blame, and ſo to walk blameleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and before men. This is the way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to make your peace with God.

                  <hi>CHAP. 10.</hi> God begins the work of Reconciliation with man.</head>
               <p>Now the thing which I thought to have finiſhed in this Chapter (but ſhal not until the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is this. <hi>That God is aforehand with his people in Reconciling himſelf, he begins the work. To wit</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>that God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world &amp;c.</hi> It is God that begins the work of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and if God did not begin it, certainly we ſhould never be reconciled unto him. It is God firſt <hi>that begins to have any thoughts about Reconciliation,</hi> and if he ſhould not have done it, we would never have thought on it, but have gone on deſperate enemies to him al our lives.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is God that finds the way of Reconcilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we could never think of a way, or if we did, we could never have found out a way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is God that begins to <hi>offer</hi> tearms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, we would never <hi>go unto God,</hi> except <hi>God came unto us,</hi> ſuch is the ſtoutneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is God that muſt not only come once, but againe, and againe; after we have refuſed, God muſt begin again.</hi> Indeed a mong'ſt men, when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior hath offended one that is above him, he wil ſay, let him come to me, if he wil. God doth not ſtand upon ſuch tearms, God doth not ſay, let man come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me firſt, No, ſaith God, I wil go unto him. A man wil ſay, if he be the ſuperior, I wil never trouble my thoughts about it; it ſhal come from him firſt. But God doth not ſay ſo, his thoughts hath been towards us, &amp; that from eternity; the Lord from eternity hath had thoughts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46564:40"/> of peace towards us, and he hath found out waies for it; and he comes firſt to offer it. But faith one that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with another; <hi>I</hi> have been content to yeild ſo far as to come to him, and to offer him Peace; but I wil never do it more; if ever there be any Reconciliation between us, I warrant you, he ſhal come to me the next time. God doth not ſay ſo to us; we were undone if he ſhould; if God ſhould come once, and offer peace to us, and upon our refuſal ſhould ſtand upon ſuch tearms as men do, and ſay, wel, I have offered peace once; but they ſhal begin next, or elſe there ſhal be no peace between us. No, ſaith God; though I have offered it once, and it hath been refuſed, I will offer it again.</p>

                  <p>Yea further; God is fain <hi>firſt to yield</hi> to his poor Creature. It may be man may be wrought ſo far as to ſay; I wil ſend to ſuch a man the ſecond time; but when they are at parly, and are together, you ſhall ſee them, (if one of them be ſuperior to the other) ſtand upon this; who ſhal yield firſt, and it wil be hard to bring the Superior to yeild. But God is not ſo. When we come to treat with God about our peace, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with him, though our hearts ſtand againſt it, yet God yeilds firſt. And for that you have a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were enemies we were Reconciled unto God;</hi> which Phraſe doth plainly note, that God is firſt contented to yield on his part: this is the infinite grace, and goodneſs towards man thus to begin with man in the point of Reconciliation.</p>

               <p>A Fourth Particular propounded at the beginning of this treatiſe in the firſt chapter, is this. <hi>That God begins firſt with man to be reconciled unto him.</hi> In this great work of making peace, it is God that begins it. <hi>God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> In which part of the verſe there are theſe four things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be handled.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God <hi>begins</hi> the work. Secondly, That it is <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, That God was a doing of this, even <hi>from eternity.</hi> And Laſtly. That the Subject of this is the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a word or two, hinted of the firſt of theſe in the laſt chapter. It is God that begins the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and if he had not begun, we would never have had thoughts of it, we would never have known how to have gone about to have reconciled our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and although we could have known how to have done it, yet our ſtout, and ſtubborn hearts would never have yeilded unto God; it is God that muſt begin the work. And he doth not onely begin with us, but indeed he continueth too: although he hath begun, yet if he do not go on, and after our rejecting being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto him the firſt, and ſecond, and third, and fourth time; if he ſhould not ſtil himſelf begin the work
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46564:41"/> a new, again, and again, and again; we would never come to be reconciled unto him. I wil but only give you two or three paſſages by way of application; having treated ſomwhat of this already; and ſo paſs on.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Let us learn to admire the goodneſs of God to wreatched man, his goodneſs that he ſhould be pleaſed to begin this work of Reconciliation with us, for do but conſider the infinite diſtance that is between God, and us. O! infinite gondneſs, that ſo great a God ſhould begin with ſuch a poor vild Creature as man is. A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt men if one be but a little inferior to an other, and if he be fallen out with him that is beneath him, he takes it in ſcorne for him to begin to make peace: No, ſaith he let him come to me, and ſeek me, if he wil. If God had ſtood upon ſuch tearms, all the Children of men would have been damned eternally. When God ſaw that we would periſh for ever, and that we would never ſo much as have thought of being reconciled to him: O, then the bowels of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion earned towards us; and ſaith he, I wil begin with them firſt, for I ſee they wilnot begin. They indeed began to make the Breach, they began to ſin againſt me and that wil be a ſecond Conſideration which makes the grace of God ſo much the more, that the breach is made on mans part: that all the wrong that is done, is on mans part. Amongſt men, if one be great though he himſelf hath done the wrong, yet he expecteth his inferior ſhould come and crouch unto him; but if his inferior have begun the quarrel, and have done the wrong he wil be ſure then to ſtand it out, and expect that his inferior ſhould ſeek after a Reconciliation with him. But here; behold, though we began the quarrel, though we had done all the wrong, and God never had done us any; yet ſo infintly gratious is the Lord, that he begins firſt. <hi>God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:46564:41"/>
                  <p>Yea, further; the Lord hath no need of us. Among men; if one fals out with another, he may happily ſay, wel, I ſee I ſhall have uſe of this man, I ſhall have need of him, for this and that buſineſs, or for ſuch and ſuch an imployment, and upon this accoumpt, though he be his inferior (for ſuperiors may have need of their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors) he is willing to be reconciled unto him; but God hath no ſuch need of us, God can tel how to glorifie his own name, though we do al periſh eternally: it is not for any uſe that God hath of us that he comes to begin the work of Reconciliation with us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, God hath us at infinite advantage to do with us what he pleaſeth. Indeed a man perhaps wil be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be reconciled with his enemy, becauſe he ſees it wil coſt him much to make his party good againſt him, it wil put him to much trouble. But there is no ſuch cauſe between God and us, for God hath us under his feet; for a man that hath gotten his enemy under his feet, and hath him at al the advantages that can be, for him to ſue to him to be reconcinciled, you wil ſay it is a rare thing, and where is there ſuch a thing in the world? But behold, God doth this with us, though he have us at infinite advantage to do with us whatſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and can fetch out his glory from our ruine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſery; yet he begins the work of Reconciliation with us. Oh! admire the infinit grace of God toward wretched and ſinfull man. This wil be the work of the Angels in Heaven to all eternity, to admire at Gods rich grace even in this one branch of the Goſpel; his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the work of Reconciliation.</p>

                  <p>And then, Another Uſe of it may be this. To teach us not to think much, but to begin to ſeek peace even with our inferiors; learn we by the example of God; that if there be falling out between one neighbor and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46564:42"/> or between one friend and another, not to think much to begin the work of peace. We think it would be a diſhonor for us to yeild ſo far; we ſay, what is he not my inferior, ſhal I ſend to him? Why, it is Gods glory to do it; God doth not only do it to us, but he accounts it his glory ſo to do. It is a great part of the glory of God that he is willing to yeild to us, and to ſend to us about tearms of Reconciliation. And ſhal that which makes God to be glorious be accounted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to thee; ſhal it make thee unglorious, when it makes God to be glorious? If it be an excellency in God, ſuerly it is no baſeneſs, no diſhonour in thee. What a proud heart haſt thou that thou ſhouldeſt think that that doth debaſe thee too much which makes God to be a glorious God, that that which doth ſet ſo much glory upon God, ſhould in thy thoughts put diſhonor upon thee, as if thy honor were to be higher than the honor of God himſelf: Certainly thoſe men that are of ſuch implacable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at leaſt they wil never yeild to begin to make up their peace with others, but they wil ſtand it out to the uttermoſt, though their conſciences tell them, that they themſelves have done a great deal of wrong, and that they could be willing there were a peace, only they wil not begin. This proud and ſtout ſpirit in men, is an argument that they have not been accquainted with Gods reconciling of himſelf unto them; for Gods begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be reconciled unto thee, wil make thee to begin reconciliation with thy inferior. You wil ſay, why ſhould not he begin firſt? It is true why ſhould he not, it is his duty indeed, and ſo it is our duty to begin with God: but ſuppoſe he doth not begin; thou ſhouldeſt rather pitty him, and look upon him in ſo much the more miſerable Condition: and know that though thou haſt the advantage of him, yet thou art to be like unto God in this particular.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, A third Uſe of Gods beginning the work of Reconciliation with us; is the Uſe that the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf makes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were enimies to God we were reconciled unto him by the death of his Son; how much more being reconciled we ſhal be ſaved by his life:</hi> here you ſee the Apoſtles inference upon Gods gratiouſneſs in himſelf; he being willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, when we were enimies; much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled we ſhal be ſaved: as if he ſhould have ſaid; al the goodneſs of God towards poor wretched ſinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when we were deſperate enemes to him, and never thought of coming in to be reconciled unto him, yet the Lord himſelf finds out a way; and begins the work of making peace between him and our ſouls: ſurely then, being reconciled unto him, we ſhal be ſaved: What, ſhal God when we were a going on in a deſperate way of enmity againſt him, ſhal this God come then to us, and have thoughts of peace and Love, and mercy to us? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we are reconciled, when we have hearts in ſome meaſure to love this God, and to ſerve, and fear him, he wil not caſt us off; certainly no, it is better with us now than before. When we were enemies unto him, and deſperate enemies, it had been then no wonder if God had caſt us off, and ſent us to our own places to lie for ever under the infinite burden of his wrath; but the Lord had then thoughts of peace towards us, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now far otherwiſe with us; though it is true, we have many corruptions in us, but we can appeal unto God that our Souls love him, and that the deſire of our hearts are to fear, and ſerve him; we can in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be able to ſay; Lord, thou that knoweſt al things, knoweſt, that there is nothing in the world our Souls deſire more than to overcome theſe Corruptions; there is no burden in al the world like unto the burden of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46564:43"/> ſin; there is nothing ſo grievous to us as this, that we have ſuch vile hearts and natures that can ſerve him no better than we do; and if God ſhould ask us what we would have from him, we can ſay in the ſincerity of our ſouls; Lord thou knoweſt we would not ask Riches, or Honors, to be Kings, and Princes in the world; but Oh, that we might be delivered from the remayner of the corruption that is in our hearts, from ſuch, and ſuch diſtempers of our Souls whereby we diſhonor thy name continually: Certainly if the hearts of men be in this diſpoſition, they may gather a comfortable argument to themſelves, and conclude thus: There was a time that I went on as a dſperate enemy unto God, and I lived without God in the world, and never minded the power, and the majeſty, and the Dominion of God over me, but as if I were born to nothing elſe but to ſin againſt God; I followed my own luſts with al manner of greedineſs, but behold then, even at that time the Lord had thoughts of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and he took me perhaps when I came to the hearing of the word with a purpoſe to contemne, and deſpiſe it, and to ieer at it; yet at that very time he took me, and ſpake to my heart, and ſhewed me Jeſus Chriſt, and his mercy, and then he broke my heart: now the Lord knows though when I come to the word I profit not as I ſhould, yet I come with a heart deſiring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and I would fain know the mind of God in it; and before I come, I go to God, and deſire him to ſhew me ſome part of his wil; Wil God now caſt me off when being a diſperate enemy to him he had thoughts of mercy towards me? wil he caſt me off for thoſe infirmities that I have now? I know I have not a heart oppoſite to that Grace, though I have a heartful of diſtempers: I am not an enemy unto God as I was before, and an enemy to his people, and ordinances; No, my heart is towards him, my heart is towards his people, and towards his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and was God reconciled to me then, even whil'ſt I was an enemy, and wil he now caſt me off
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46564:43"/> for weakneſſes; and infirmities? Certainly it cannot be. O make much of that place of the Apoſtle. <hi>If when we were enemies unto God we were reconciled unto him; much more,</hi> ſaith he; certainly now God wil not caſt us off, but we ſhal be ſaved. That is a third uſe that we may make of Gods begining the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>

                  <p>A Fourth is this; Was God beginning with us, and did he ſo begin with us? then let not us be backward with God, let us not hang off in any duty when God cals us to do it, but preſently come in; let it not be long before we perform any duty, let us not ſtand out, and defer with God, and ſay, I wil, and I wil hereafter: certainly that Soul that comes to underſtand the goodneſs of God, how God began with us in making of peace before ever we had thoughts of it; it wil be a mighty argument to put the Soul on to make haſt to the doing of any duty which God calls for, and to be ſpeedy in the Service of God, becauſe he was pleaſed at firſt to begin. But we paſs that of Gods beginning to be reconciled unto us, and come to that which is indeed the main in this point of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Text; and even the principal of al the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines that are in the Goſpel; <hi>To wit, That God was in, Chriſt Reconcileing the world to himſelf.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. 12. Doct.</hi> Our Reconciliation with God is made in Chriſt. Seven things propounded for opening the Doctrin.</head>
               <p>YOu have read much of the bleſſedneſs of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what a happy condition it is to be at peace with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46564:44"/> God, eſpecially in theſe times of war, and trouble, when there is ſo little peace in the Land. And you have read that God begins the work; But how doth he do it? obſerve; it is not God meerly conſidered as Creator of Heaven, and Earth, that infinite firſt being of al things; But (the firſt thing propounded in the firſt Chapter to be opened is this,) It is God <hi>[in Chriſt]</hi> reconciling him to the world. God and man were enemies; an enmity, and a breach there was, and the breach was infinitely wide, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; how ſhal God and man now come to be reconciled? you wil ſay, the Lord is a God of infinite mercy, and he ſees his poor creatures muſt needs periſh eternally if he come to take advantage againſt them; therefore it may be God was willing to paſs by al, and ſo free of himſelf, and his own free Grace to be reconciled to ſuch, and ſuch creatures as have ſinned againſt him, and ſo Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made up; No, this was not the way, there is more required than this. Let God, and the creature be put together without any Further Conſideration: and al the mercy of God on the one ſide; and al the Cries, and tears and repentings of the creature, on the other ſide, this wil never make up a peace. This you muſt know is the Doctrine of the Goſpel; that man having made a breach betwixt God, and himſelf, and conſider God meerly in himſelf, as he is himſelf, without relation to a Mediator; and then take al the mercy of God on one ſide, and al the tears, and repentings, the Cries and Prayers of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on the otherſide; and both theſe together can never make peace. What muſt there be more, you wil ſay? That which we have in the Text, God <hi>[in Chriſt]</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world. It is not God in himſelf reconciling the world to himſelf, but it is God in Chriſt. So that there muſt come ſomthing between God, and us as to the matter of Reconciliation, or otherwiſe there can never be a Reconciliation made. This thing I have often had occaſion to treat of; and I am very willing upon every occaſion to ſet this before thoſe that I am to preach unto;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46564:44"/> for this is the great truth of the Goſpel; and truly al our preaching ſhould be, even to bring this truth home to the hearts of people; and whatſoever we preach, if it be not in order to this, we loſe our labor, and God hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glory from what we do, except it be in order to this; or as it may be ſome way a fruit of it. So then the point is this.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>Our Reconciliation with God is made in Chriſt.</hi> As we read of <hi>Jonah</hi> when the ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts werein the Sea, and when the waves roared, and when the ſhip and the Marriners and al were like to be ſwallowed up, when <hi>jonah</hi> was caſt into the ſea, preſently there was a calm. So, the ſtormes, and tempeſts of Gods everlaſting wrath are up againſt a Sinner, and the waves of that wrath are ready to ſwallow him up; But now Chriſt is caſt into the heart of a man, and Chriſt being preſented as one ſtanding between God and man, al comes to be at a Calme. When the Diſciples were upon the Sea, and the Sea troubleſome; yet when Chriſt came, and rebuked the Sea, and the winds, all was ſtil. So when there are troubles of Conſcience, nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thoſe troubles of Conſcience; nothing can bring in peace and quiet into the ſoul, but only Chriſt coming into the heart; God is <hi>[in Chriſt]</hi> reconciling the world to himſelf. There is nothing more plain in the Scripture than this; that it is God in Chriſt that reconciles the world to himſelf. It is evident enough in the text, but I wil give you a Scripture, or two for it, and then proceed to the opening of the point. That place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 1. is moſt cleer; <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God;</hi> How? <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> no peace with God, but through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is an eaſy matter for us to ſay ſo; but to apprehend the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of this, that it muſt be through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that we have peace with God; to apprehend this cleerly, and throughly, it is a great matter; and thoſe know much of the minde of God that know this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46564:45"/> and powerfully. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13.14. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt you that were far off are made nigh through his blood, for he is our peace:</hi> This is ſpoken in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards; he is our peace with God, it is apparent that it muſt be ſpoken in that regard, for ſo it follows in verſe 18. <hi>through him we have acceſs unto the father;</hi> but it is ſpoken of Chriſts being our peace in regard of uniting us to the Church of God, to be made one with the people of God; but no ſaith God here is a reconciliation, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, and then a union with the people of God, with the church of God; the partition wal is broken down through Chriſt; and thoſe that were as doggs before, are now ſet up at the table: and there is a peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods people and us; for ſo Chriſt makes peace that way in taking away the enmity, that the people of God might be one together, as wel as they are one with God. So in <hi>Collo.</hi> 1 21, 22. <hi>You that were ſomtimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated, and enimies in your mindes by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled;</hi> How? <hi>In the body of his fleſh through death to preſent you holy, and blamleſs, and unreprovable in his fight:</hi> and that in verſe the 20. is remarkable for this purpoſe; <hi>have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>made peace,</hi> How? <hi>through the blood of his Croſs by him to reconcile althings to himſelf: [by him]</hi> I ſay. ſo that the Apoſtle would put an emphaſis on this, that we are reconciled by Chriſt, <hi>By him,</hi> Saith he: and he was not ſatisfied in ſaying of it once, but he repeateth it again, <hi>by him,</hi> I <hi>Say, whether they be things on Earth, or things in Heaven.</hi> There are two difficulties in this Scripture. firſt in that it is ſaid, God hath reconciled al things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Chriſt; how doth God reconcile all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Chriſt? we are now ſpeaking of reconciling thoſe that ſhal be Saved eternally; but here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of reconciling of all things: God may be ſaid to reconcile, not only Saints, but al things unto himſelf in this regard: In that al things were lyable to diſtruction through mans Sin; and it is in Chriſt, and through Chriſt that any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46564:45"/> thing in the world is preſerved in a good Condition. When you behold the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea, and al theſe things, and ſee the preſervation of them in any good Condition; you muſt know it is al through Chriſt; and had it not been in regard of Chriſt, al things would have come to ruine, and confuſion preſenly, and ſo God reconcileth al things to himſelf in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Further; Al things are reconciled in Chriſt too, in this regard: In that now al things are through him come to be made Serviceable to thoſe that are his Saints, and reconciled ones; and in that regard al things may be ſaid to be reconciled to God; becauſe they are reconciled to Gods friends; whereas before, al Creatures were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us through Sin; and now through Chriſt they come to be made uſeful to us; and ſo unto God by us. A Second difficulty in this text is, How God hath by Chriſt reconciled al things in heaven; what things are there in Heaven that are Reconciled to God by Chriſt? We muſt underſtand that the things in Heaven that are ſaid to be reconciled, are eſpecially to be meant of the Angels. But you wil ſay; How can the angels be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Chriſt, there was never a falling out, never an enmity between God and them? I Anſwer, That though in a proper ſence, as reconciliation Concerns man, there is no reconciling of Angels unto God; yet becauſe there is a neerer and a further and a more firm union made between God and the Angels through Jeſus Chriſt than ever there was before or than ever there ſhould have been, for ought we know, if Chriſt hade not been; in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard reconciliation may be ſaid to be of things in Heaven; God and them being now by Chriſt more firmly made one, than ever they were before. And again though the Angels had never Sinned againſt God, and ſo were no actual enemies unto God; yet they were in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning, for they being but Creatures, they could not but be frail in themſelves; and ſo lyable to fal from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46564:46"/> God and to ſin againſt him as wel as thoſe that did fal; therefore in regard of the eſtabliſhment which they have now through Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in ſuch a condition, that they are in an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of falling from God, God having ſo taken them to himſelf, and they being ſo one with God, that they can never fal from him; in this regard alſo they may be ſaid to be reconciled. For notwithſtanding al the perfection of their Creation, they might have fallen into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that thoſe did that are now reſerved in Chaynes to the Judgment of the great day. But now God hath ſo reconciled al things in Heaven by Jeſus Chriſt, that the Angels themſelves are more firmly made one with God than they were before. And further; the Lord doth receive them into a more intire affection of love, in, and by Jeſus Chriſt, than he did before; the Lord looking upon the Angels, in and through Chriſt, there is a more through, firme, intimate intire affection of God towards them to eſtabliſh them, and to accept of them in Jeſus Chriſt. And beſides they are reconciled to God, or unto us rather, becauſe they are come to be our friends, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at firſt they were our enemies, ſo that in that regard there is a kind of Reconciliation; but becauſe I conceive the text doth not ſo much intend that, we ſhal let it paſs. Thus you ſee how God was in Chriſt reconciling to himſelf, even in ſome ſenſe the very Angels themſelves. This then is the firſt thing; the very thoughts that God had of entering into any tearmes, or parly with man about peace, is by Chriſt; that the Lords heart was inclined to man, it is from Chriſt; that the Lord would be willing to accept of any ſatisfaction, it is through Chriſt; that we have an acceſs to God any way, it is through Chriſt. There is nothing from the one end of the work of Reconciliation to the other, but it is al through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For further opening of this great point, there are theſe things to be propounded.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:46564:46"/>
               <p>Firſt, Briefly, to ſhew you the neceſſity of Chriſts coming in, in order to our Reconciliation with God, and likewiſe that it could be no other way, but by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How Chirſt comes to be a fit Reconciler.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What it is that Chriſt hath ingaged himſelf to, and performed according to his ingagement for our Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How that which Chriſt hath done comes to be made over to us, and that we come to have the fruit of it for our Reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The Conſequences that flow from this; Namely, that our Reconciliation comes through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The reaſons why God wil be reconciled to us through his Son, rather than any other way. And</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To make ſome Application of al.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars might hold us ſome time; but becauſe we often meet with much of this Doctrine of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have divers times before, and are likely, if God lengthen out opportunities ſtil to do it; therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to preſent al theſe ſeven particulars before you in a very ſhort view.</p>

               <p>FOr the firſt, The neceſſity of Chriſts coming in for our Reconciliation; and ſurely this is that which is to be in culcated, and beaten upon you again &amp; again, for you neither know God nor Chriſt, nor your own eſtates, except you know the neceſſity of Chriſts coming in to undertake in the work of Reconciliation. I ſuppoſe if we ſhould ask any of you, how you hope to be ſaved;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46564:47"/> you wil preſently anſwer, by Jeſus Chriſt. But the underſtanding of the abſolute neceſſity that there was of Chriſts coming in to reconcile us, and God together, is not ſo ordinary; therefore I beſeech you ſeriouſly weigh it. The neceſſity of it in a word is this: There was ſuch a diſtance made between God, and his Creatures through ſin, as did put a neceſſity upon a Mediator to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; the diſtance was ſo great; for God being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite firſt being, and we being his Creatures, the diſtance muſt needs be great; it is ſin that made the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and us; and that was ſo vaſt, and wide, that it did neceſſarily require a Mediator to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and eſpecially upon this ground; becauſe the Lord was reſolved to have that wrong that was done unto him by the ſin of man perfectly made up; ſin had wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God, and God was reſolved upon it, he was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to have this wrong compleatly made up, and that he himſelf would be perfectly righted; and this Gods Juſtice cals for; and thus ſtood the tearms between God, and Man; Man having wronged God, and God and He are now at varience, and God ſtands upon it, and is reſolved with himſelf thus; though I be willing to be at peace with them, yet I wil be at peace with them, ſo as I wil have the wrong that is done made up; my Juſtice ſhal be fully, and compleatly ſatisfied; I muſt be righted, for I am God; and there ſhal not be ſuch a flaw remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in my Juſtice to eternity, as that ſuch and ſuch Creatures ſhould ſin againſt me, and I paſs it by without having any ſatisfaction; for ſaith God, this would be a flaw in my Juſtice for ever, and that I will not have, and therefore I will be righted in that wrong that is done me by the fal of Man. It is true, when one man comes to treat about peace, and Reconciliation with another, it is ſomtimes neceſſary for him to paſs by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence without any ſatisfaction at al, eſpecially when that poor Creature that hath offended is not able to make ſatisfaction; but it is not ſo between God and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46564:47"/> Man; though one Man being at variance with another, when he ſees that he that hath done him the wrong cannot make ſatisfaction, he then is indeed to paſs it by; but Gods mercy did never work after that manner, though the mercy in a man may work him to ſuch a Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and though God be a God of infinite mercy, infinitly more merciful than any Creature can be, yet the way of the working of Gods, mercy is a different way from the working of the Creatures mercy; neither doth it argue that there is not as much mercy in God as there is in the Creature; but that the way of the working of Gods mercy is different from that of the Creatures, and this is the way of the working of Gods mercy, not to paſs by the wrong done, but to provide ſome means or other himſelf to ſatisfie that wrong, to the end that he may have his Juſtice ſatisfied; and becauſe that this was neceſſary, hence it comes to paſs of our being reconciled unto God through Jeſus Chriſt. The neceſſity of Chriſts being a Mediator is not ſo much this, that we are grieveous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo we have need of abundance of mercy from God; if there were nothing but theſe two only; that we are great ſinners, and ſo have need of great mercy, there would not come a neceſſity of Chriſt; But we are great ſinners, and we have need of the mercy of God, and the wrong that ſin hath done unto God muſt be made up, and his Juſtice fully ſatisfied, and here comes in the neceſſity of a Chriſt. And thus God was Reconciling himſelf to the world in this regard. And the truth is, though ſome of you have heard the ſound of this often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; yet you muſt know, this is the great miſtery of the Goſpel, and by our preſenting this unto you again, and again, perhaps God wil give you a further inſight into this truth; It is this that the Angels deſire ſo much to pry into; they know this, that Gods Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, but they know it not ſo, and ſo as the Church knows it, and as the Saints know it, and therefore they pry more, and more into it to ſee the further depths of it;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46564:48"/> as indeed there is greater and greater depths in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which we can never fathom, and which is only reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the time of the Reſurrection. Moſt people think, that when they are to ſeek for Reconciliation with God, they have to do with God only as a merciful God; But you muſt know when you have to do with God about Reconciliation, you have to do with more than with the mercy of God; ye have to do with God reconciling himſelf to the world in his Son, and you can never ſeek Reconciliation with God in a right Evangelical way, unleſs you ſeek it in his Son. That briefly ſhal ſuffice for the firſt; The neceſſity of Chriſts coming in to the work of Reconciliation.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond thing propounded in the twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this. How Chriſt comes to be a fit Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler; it is he who is the great Peace-maker; and therefore in the Scripture he is called the Prince of peace; it is he that is <hi>Melchezedeck,</hi> King of righteouſneſs, and King of peace; But how comes he to be ſo? by being a Mediator between the Father and us: and ſo you ſhal find he is called in the Scripture. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8, 6. <hi>But he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more Excellent Miniſtry by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> that is, of a Covenant of grace, and not of that covenant of works. Now Chriſt he is a fit mediator to come in, and to mediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46564:48"/> God, and us. As amongſt men when there is a Breach between two, and they are at a Diſtance; the Breach is ſuch as requires one to come in, and to mediate be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween them; It is not alwayes neceſſary between man and man where there is a Breath, that one ſhould come and mediate; but there being a Breath between God, and us, it was abſolutely neceſſary that a mediator ſhould come in to treat between God and us, and there could never have been the leaſt parly, the leaſt treaty between God, and fallen man, had not a mediator ſtept in between and this mediator is Jeſus Chriſt, and it is he that is only fit to be our Reconciler, and Peace-Maker.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is the Second Perſon in Trinity, and in that regard he is fit.</p>
               <p>You wil Say; How doth this make him fit? Thus; The Sin that was committed in the firſt tranſgreſſion was more directly againſt the firſt Perſon, God the Father. Why, wil you ſay, was it againſt one Perſon rather than againſt another? It was indeed againſt them al; but it was more directly againſt the firſt Perſon; and this is the reaſon of it, becauſe mans firſt ſin was againſt that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which God gave him in his creation; againſt that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated righteouſnes that was put into him which was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the work of the firſt perſon in trinity; for Creation is attributed to the firſt perſon; and man ſining againſt that work of Creation, hence it comes to paſs that the firſt is more directly, and immediatly offended. Now therfore the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, he comes next in Order, and therefore it is he that is fit to be a Reconciler between the father and us, becauſe we having ſinned againſt the work of Creation, God the father unto whom that worke is attributed, is more eſpecially offended.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But not only ſo, for if he had been but only the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon; if he had been but only the Son of God, he could not have been the reconciler of us unto God, and therefore there muſt be ſomwhat elſe. When we ask you what Chriſt is; you Ordinarily anſwer the Son of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46564:49"/> God: but if that had been al, if he had been only the Son of God, and the Second Perſon in Trinity, he could not (according to that way which God hath revealed in his word that he wil be reconciled unto Sinners by) have been a fit mediator for us. Therefore in the Second place, that he might be a fit mediator to make our peace, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God, and us together, <hi>he comes and takes our nature upon him, and is made a very man; ſo that the ſame Perſon is now God, and man;</hi> he having taken up the nature into a perſonal union with the Son of God; ſo that he pertakes of both thoſe natures which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, obſerve it wel. Chriſt who is to be the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler, his buſineſs is to reconcile God and man, between whom there was ſo vaſt a Breach. Now to the end that he might be fit for this work and reconcile theſe two, God and man, he partakes of both natures, and is become, by uniting the nature of man which he tooke to himſelfe, into Perſonal union with the Godhead, both God, and man, and having the nature of them both, he hath intereſt in them both; he hath intereſt in God the father as being the ſame God coequal with the father, though not the ſame in a Perſonal regard, but the ſame God with the Father: and he hath intereſt likewiſe in man, as he hath the ſame nature with him; and thus he partaking of God, and partaking of man, comes to have intereſt in both, and in that regard becomes a fit mediator between God and us. Here is the great work of God to reconcile man to himſelf; and in this, God muſt do a work that is far greater than the making of Heaven, and the Earth. It had not been ſo great a work for God to have made ten thouſand worlds over again, as for God to make a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to become God and man in one Perſon. The union of the two natures of Chriſt is the greateſt work that ever God did from al eternity, or ever ſhal be done, and yet this was required to reconcile us to himſelf; and ſurely you may wel conclude, that the work of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of a ſinner to God, is a greater buſineſs, ſeeing that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46564:49"/> Heaven and Earth muſt be moved about it; and that the greateſt work that ever was done, or ever ſhal be done, muſt be done about this, or elſe it had never been effected. The Second perſon in Trinity muſt come, and take our Nature, and be made in the form of a Servant, that ſo he might be a fit peace-maker, or Mediator between God the Father and us. And then.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a fil Mediator in this; That he knows fully the mind of the Father; and throughly underſtands, even to the utmoſt what wrong the Father hath received by our ſin. If one ſhould come to Mediate between one Man, and another, and ſhould deſire the party offended to be at peace; He wil ſay; you ſpeak thus unto me; but do you know what wrong ſuch a one hath done me? if you underſtood the wrong he hath done me, ſurely you would not think it ſo eaſie a matter for me to be at peace; and the truth is, if al the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and al the men in the world ſhould come to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to make peace between God, and any ſinner for any one ſin; God would preſently Anſwer them, and ſay, what do you do to come to undertake this work of making peace with me and a ſinner; alas you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what wrong is done unto me by his ſin; you know not what injury I have received by his ſin, therefore you are not a fit party to be a Mediator. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no Angel in Heaven could poſſibly be a fit Peace-maker between God and Man, for they know not what wrong ſin hath done unto God; But Jeſus Chriſt knows to the utmoſt, he underſtands throughly, and fully al the wrong, and injury that is done unto the Father by the ſin of Man; he knows what prejudice his Father ſuſtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by al the ſins of al the men of the world, which no Creature elſe, Angels, nor Men could ever do. Nay, they are ſo far from knowing the wrong that is done to God by the ſins of the world, as they are not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the wrong that is done unto God by one of the leaſt ſins that can be committed.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:46564:50"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is a fit Mediator; becauſe he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew what would pleaſe and ſatisfie his father. If a man ſhould come to be a mediator, to reconcile two that are at difference, if indeed he knew the mind of the Party offended fully and throughly, we would rather chuſe ſuch a man to make up the Breach, ſuch a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that doth underſtand to a hair what wil ſatisfie the offended Party is fit to be a Mediator. All the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven do not know like unto Jeſus Chriſt, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and throughly the mind of God, or what it is that wil ſatisfie him: it is onely Jeſus Chriſt who was with the father, and lay in his very boſom from all eternity, that knows fully what wil ſatisfie the wrong that is done to the father, and therefore he alone was fitteſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this work.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Chriſt is a fit Mediator in this, That God the father doth infinitly love him, that he is infinitely dear to the father; and you know that it is a ſpecial ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thoſe to have that are to be Reconcilers, that they ſhould be dear one to another, eſpecially dear to the party that is offended. If a poor man hath offended a rich man in a Town, and he ſaith within himſelf, O! that I were reconciled unto ſuch a one. If he can get one that is the intimate friend that that rich man hath in all the world to ſpeak unto him in his behalf, he wil conclude, that certainly the buſineſs ſhal have good ſucceſs, and that this friend wil prevail. Thus it is with our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; he who is our Reconciler unto God, is infinitely dear unto the father, God the father doth infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him; and therefore whatſoever he ſhal ſay, or do, muſt needs infinitely pleaſe God the father. This is our Mediator who is come to reconcile us unto God, he can ſay, and do nothing but it ſhal infinitely pleaſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the father.</p>
               <p>Further, He is one that never did offend. There may be a friend that is very dear to the party offended and yet perhaps he himſelf hath offended the Party.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46564:50"/> But Jeſus Chriſt is one that never offended the father, but hath pleaſed him from all eternity, and therefore he is a fit mediator, he is fit to Speake for thoſe that have diſpleaſed him. As in a family, if a Child have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and another Child come and ſpeak for his Brother, the father may anſwer, you need ſpeke for your ſelf for you have offended as wel as he: But if another child that never offended his father in al his life, but hath been the moſt obedient Child that can be in the world, ſhal come, and ſpeake, this wil be likely to take with the Father much. God the Father profeſſeth before al the world, that Jeſus Chriſt is his Beloved Son in whom he is wel pleaſed; and it is this Chriſt that ſtands up to ſpeake to God the Father for poore Sinners to be reconciled unto him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly he is a fit mediator in this; That whatſoever he ſhal do hath an infinit efficace in it ſelfe: not only is he a fit mediator becauſe God is wel pleſed with him; but becauſe that whatſoever he ſhal lay doune by way of ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, it hath an infinet value in it. There is ſuch an infinite price ſuch an infinit worth in whatſoever Chriſt lays doun to porchaſe this reconciliation, that the infinite Juſtice of God cannot but ſay, this is indeed a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Conſideration, and I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg there is efficacy, and ſufficiency enough in this to make up a ful Satisfaction had the Sinns of men been a thouſand times more than they were.</p>
               <p>Now, what a mediator have we to reconcile us unto God; how comes our ſins to make ſuch a breach between God, and us? but becauſe our ſins were againſt ſuch an infinite God at firſt; the Perſon againſt whom we have ſinned is the cauſe which makes ſuch a breach; and ſo the Perſon who is mediator, that ſhal do and ſuffer any thing for us being ſuch a perſon as he is; hence comes the efficacy of al that he ſhal doe, and ſuffer to ſatisfie the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the utmoſt groat. Al this together, namely Chriſt that is the Second Perſon, who is God, and man,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46564:51"/> Who knows the minde of the father to the ful. Who knows what wrong our Sins have done the Father. Who knows what wil ſatisfie the Father. Who never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the father. Who is infinitly beloved of the father. Al theſe together makes it, that whatſoever he doth hath an infinite efficacy to ſatisfie Juſtice it ſelfe; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he comes to be a fit mediator. Al theſe things J name the rather to incourage the heart of poore Sinners to come unto him; ſeing it is God in Chriſt that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth us to himſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAp. 15.</hi> What Chriſt hath under taken and performed in Our Reconciliation <hi>1</hi> to fatisfy Gods Juſtice <hi>2</hi> To bring our hearts and ſubdue them to God.</head>
               <p>You wil ſay; you have ſhewed us theſe two things; that it is not God alone, and us, but in Chriſt, and us, that is reconciled. And you have ſhewd us what a reconciler Chriſt is. And how fit. But for the third thing propounded in the 12. Chapter, hath Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to reconcile us? Surely this is a great work to come and reconcile Sinful man unto God; Chriſt muſt needs undertake much in this? I wil declare to you what Chriſt hath undertaken.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This agrement there is between Chriſt and the Father, <hi>He hath undertaken that he wil Satisfie what ever his Fathers Juſtice ſhal requier.</hi> As for example. If one ſhould come to mak a peace between a couple, and the one party hath extreamly injured the other, and he that comes to make peace; he doth not only come and ſay, Sir I beceech you for my ſake, paſs by the wrong, and be reconciled unto him, though perhaps this may do much but this wil not do the deed; and this is not the way of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46564:51"/> reconcileing God and us, for Chriſt (though he be dear to the father) only to plead, and Say, O father theſe poor Creatures have offended the, I beſeech the O father, be reconciled to them; no this is not al. But ſaith the Party offended; wil you under take to ſatisfie the wrong that is done me? I ſaith he, who is the Peace-maker, I wil undertake it al; you ſhal ſet it al upon my ſcor. And certainly you wil al conclude, that if he that comes to be mediator, and is dear unto the Party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhal not only intreat, but undertake, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would have of him, requier what ſatisfaction ſoever he wil, he wil undertake to under goe it al, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be a man able to do what he promiſeth: You wil al conclude that this wil ſurly make up a peace. This is the tranſaction between God the Father, and the Son. God lookes upon man as being an enimy to him, and Chriſt he comes to mediate, yea, but ſaith the father; what wil you do to make peace, wil you undertake for mankind, wil you ingage to Satisfy that wrong that they have done me? Yes O Father ſaith Chriſt, I wil do it, I wil ſtand betwen the and them, and undertake for them to ſatisfie al whatſoever thy Juſtice can require. And in this regard Chriſt is not only called a mediator in that place <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. and ſo forward; but he is called a Suerty, becauſe he hath undertaken to Satisfie what God the father requred for the Sin of mankind; and as he hath undertaken it; ſo he hath done it now, and the fathers that lived in former times might looke upon God reconciling himſelfe to the world in Chriſt, as Chriſt had undertaken it, but not fully diſcharged it. But we may look upon Chriſt, not only as an undertaker, but as one that hath diſcharged, and paid al.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But that is not al; Chriſt hath not only undertaken this; but in the next place, as he hath undertaken to ſatisfie God on his part; but ſaith the Father; what ſhal become of theſe poor Creatures; they have hearts oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to me, and they are enemies to me, and whatſoever
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46564:52"/> you do, they wil ſtil go on in waies of emnity to me? No, ſaith Chriſt; <hi>I</hi> wil do more then this, <hi>I wil under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to bring them in to you, and to ſubdue their hearts to you; and whereas they are now enemies to you; they ſhal come, and ſubmit themſelves; and that wicked Nature of theirs, I wil take away through my ſpirit, and I wil both bring them into a peaceable diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; ſo that they ſhal love you as a friend, and love al that belong unto you; they ſhal love al your waies, and love your people, and love your holyneſs;</hi> I wil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to bring them in to you, as wel as to ſatisfie you for what they have done. This is appearent; for in the Scripture where ever there is any ſpeaking of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you have mention of our being reconciled to God, as wel as Gods being reconciled to us; and indeed the Scripture doth make more mention of our Reconciling being enemies to God, than of any thing of Gods working Reconciliation for us. And that place that I quoted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Colloſians, is exceedging cleer for this; namely, that Chriſt hath undertaken for our Reconciliation, for you heard before in, <hi>Collo.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That he had made peace through the blood of his Croſs;</hi> He hath undertaken to ſatisfie; and the undertaking of it coſt him his blood; our Reconciliation coſt Chriſts death. But then in verſe 21. He ſaith further; <hi>You that were ſomtimes alina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and enemies in your minds by wicked works,</hi> ſo it is in your Books; but in the Original, it is; <hi>Enemies in your minds [in] wicked works;</hi> not that you came to be enemies by your works, for that is the advantage indeede that the adverſaries have, and ſay; it is not a ſinful Nature in us, but we come by action to act wicked habits; but it is, you are enemees in your minds <hi>in</hi> works; that is, you did lay out al the enmity of your minds againſt God; you have natural enmity in your minds againſt God: and in your minds you do lay out; and improve this ſtrength of your enmity in your wicked
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46564:52"/> works againſt God; But ſaith he you that were thus allienated, and enemies in your minds in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works, he hath reconciled, to preſent you holy, and unblameable, and inreprovable in his ſight. Here are two waies by which Chriſt reconciles us unto God; he hath reconciled us by the blood of his Croſs; and then in the Body of his fleſh through death to preſent us holy, and unblamable, and unreprovable in his ſight; he hath undertaken this latter, as wel as that other; and he hath undertaken, that we ſhal not remain enemies unto God eternally, but that there ſhal be a time when we ſhal be brought in to God, and have graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſitions put into us, ſo as we ſhal become frie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds unto God, and friends unto al that are Gods. There are many that ſpeak much of Chriſt in regard of his ſatisfaction, and what the tranſaction was between God and him; and they think that becauſe Chriſt hath undertaken to ſatisfie Gods wrath, what need we care for any thing? what is it, though we live as we liſt? it is to no purpoſe what we do, whether we do il, or whether we do wel, for Chriſt hath done al in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. But my Brethren ſee the miſtake: Chriſt hath not only undertaken ſatisfaction, and to reconcile God unto us; but he hath undertaken with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe to reconcile us unto him; not to ſatisfie God alone, but to bring us into a gracious fram, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of heart likewiſe; and therefore except Chriſt do both, the truth is he doth neither; It is true the one may be done from al eternity; Chriſt may undertake the one, and undertake that he wil do the other alſo; but until Chriſt hath actually done the other, thou canſt not conclude, that he hath done the former. That man that perſwades himſelf that Jeſus Chriſt hath done the former, when as he hath not done the latter deceivs himſelf; and therefore to beleeve in Chriſt as a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler, is to beleeve in Chriſt as undertaking theſe two things. Firſt undertaking with God the Father to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46564:53"/> make ſatisfaction unto him. And then Secondly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking for us, to bring us in to the Father likewiſe: and as Chriſt muſt do the one, as well as the other; ſo he wil be as faithfull in the performing the Second, as he was in the undertaking, and diſchargeing the Firſt. Few people think of this, they think much of Chriſts undertaking to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, and ſo to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them unto God; but they have ſeldome thoughts of this, that Chriſt hath alſo undertaken to chang their hearts, and to make them friends unto God. But you that go on in wicked works being enemies to God in your minds in wicked works, perhaps you think God wil be Reconciled unto you through Chriſt, and when you die you ſhal be ſaved through him. Remember this point. That Chriſt the Reconciler hath undertaken with God the Father both to ſatisfie his Juſtice, and to ſubdue your hearts, ſo that you ſhal no longer be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies unto him; and therefore if Chriſt have not done the other, in your hearts, it is an evident argument, that for ought that yet appears he never undertook to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for you. O! what an argument is here, for men to be reſtleſs, and unquiet in their natural condition; You that go on in a ſinful, and &amp; ungodly way, you may certainly know, that there is for the preſent no evidence that Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken with the Father to make any Reonciliation for you, for if he had, he hath alſo undertaken on your parts to bring in your hearts to the Father and to make you friends with him, as wel as him friends with you. On the other ſide, any of you that find the work of the Spirit in your hearts, that begin to find Chriſt ſubduing your hearts unto God; that whereas heretofore you did live in waies of enmity unto God, but now you begin to find the power of Chriſt in his word beating down thoſe proud hearts of yours, you find Chriſt changing of your minds, and ſo bringing of your hearts into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto God; Bleſs God for this, and know that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46564:53"/> this is part of Chiſts undertaking with God the Father, and in that he doth this in your hearts, it is an Evidence that he hath undertaken to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for all your ſins.

                  </gap>oncilition, come to be made Ours. <hi>1.</hi> Chriſt the head of the ſecond Covenant.</head>
               <p>There is a fourth thing which I propounded in the twelfe Chapter; and that is, How we come to be reconciled to God in Chriſt; It is true, Chiſt hath done it you ſee: But how do we come to have what Chriſt hath done made ours, that ſo we may be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God?</p>
               <p>In a word thus. Chriſt is looked upon by God the Father as the Head of the Second Covenant, and ſo we are looked upon in him as Covenanters, and as joyned together in one body in him: this is the way of Chriſts Reconciling God &amp; us, &amp; the way of the Conveyance of al the fruits of that Reconciliation unto us. This is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of God concerning the Children of men, that they may come to be reconciled, and ſaved. As his Son hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the thing; ſo it is not only, that he ſhould ſtand between the Father and us. Its remarkable there muſt be a Union between him, and us, and he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us to God the the Father as one Body with himſelf, and the Father muſt look upon him as the Head of a Covenant to which we belong likwiſe: So that his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſufferring is to be looked upon now; not as done by a private perſon; But looked upon as the obedience, and ſuffering of a publick Perſon, of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46564:54"/> one that Bears our Names before God the Father. And herein there is a further miſtery of godlines. The reconciliation between man, and man, is only when one that is a ſtranger, comes and ſtands between, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth; there is not required ſuch a union between him that he mediateth for, and himſelfe. But Chriſt comes not in meerly as a third perſon between God and us, but he comes to take our very natures upon him, and we are made one in the covenant of grace he as the Head, and we as the members. That look as Adam ſtood before God as the Head of the firſt Covenant of works, and ſo we were al looked upon at firſt in him, and dyed in him: So Chriſt who is called the Second Adam ſtands before the Lord as the Head of the Second Covenant and al thoſe that he doth mediate for, and whom he doth ſeek to reconcile to the father, ſtand al before the father in him; ſo that his work is imputed to be theirs, and the Lord looketh upon them in their Head: fulfiling that Second Covenant of life, and peace that he hath made with poor creatures in him. So that you muſt not only look upon Chriſt to be a Saviour, as the Son of God in Heaven; but if you would look upon him with comfort, you muſt look upon him as the head of a ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and upon your ſelves joyned with him as members of him and ſo preſented unto the father through him. Thus God was in Chriſt reconciling himſelf to the world, God looking upon Chriſt, and through Chriſt, as the head of the Covenant of grace; upon al thoſe that Chriſt did undertake for, as Covenanters Joyned together with him, comes to be reconciled to al thoſe which ſhal be everlaſtingly Saved. This is the miſtery of the Goſpel, God in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf. What Chriſt was hath been opened. And what Chriſt hath undertaken. and how God looks upon us through this mediator. Theſe things you muſt ſearch into, and cry unto God that by his Spirit he whuld open theſe miſteries of the Goſpel unto you, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46564:54"/> then you ſhal ſee much of the miſtery of grace, and of the minde of god; and ſo come to have abundance of peace with God, notwithſtanding al the preſent remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of uncleannes that are in your hearts.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. 17.</hi> How we come to have intreſt in what Chriſt hath done is further opened:</head>
               <p>WE have ſhewed in the former chapter what Chriſt doth for the Continuance of this peace between God, and us: that he is at the right hand of God, there making interceſſion for the Saints continualy; ſo that if ther be any thing, that might (in its own nature) break the peace between God, and us; this our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſits at the right hand of the Father, and there (by his interceſſion) he continually preſents himſelf for the removing of it, and for the continuance of the peace be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween God and us; that there may no Breach fal out, for the time to come; this I ſay Chriſt undertakes to do, and this is a ſpecial work of his Mediation; namly, his being Continually at the right hand of the Father, and there preſenting himſelfe unto God for the keping, and mantaining of this peace, which he hath made between the Father, and us.</p>
               <p>Again; if it be demanded; how we come to have an Intreſt in this that Chriſt doth; (which was the fourth thing propounded in the twelfth chapter) in his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in al that he undertakes?</p>
               <p>The Anſweer was this: That Chriſt is made the Head of a ſecond Covenant; for, as the foundation of the Breach, that was between God and us at the firſt came by the firſt man Adam, who was the Head of the firſt Covenant, in whom we al Sinned, and ſo turned eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46564:55"/> unto God: So Jeſus Chriſt is made a Second Adam, and the head of a Second Covenant; and al thoſe that are looked upon as the poſterity of the Second Adam, (for ſo it muſt be) they are looked upon as one in him. As al that were of the poſterity of the firſt Adam were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as one man in him, and ſo the Breach was made, and enmity came between God, and al that one mans poſterity: ſo, al that are to be of the Poſterity of the Second Adam, that are either actually of him, or are to be born of him by a Spiritual generation, (which in the Scripture is tearmed Regeneration); al thoſe are looked upon as one with him: and hence it is that in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the firſt, and ſecond Adam as if there were no more but two men in the world, for indeed ther are no more in that ſenſe; nor ever were. The firſt man (ſaith the apoſtle) is of the Earth, Earthly; the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven, Heavenly. here is the firſt man, and the Second man. Why, you wil ſay, are there but two men in the world? No, not in that ſenſe; that is, there were never but two men that did repreſent al others; and under thoſe two men are al other men in the world repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before God. Al the children of men that fel from God, the are repreſented in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the Head of the firſt Covenant, and they ſtand under that covenant: And al thoſe that God intends to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto, and to glorifie; they are repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> who is the Head of the Second Covenant. It is true, if we ſpeake properly; <hi>Caine</hi> was in order the ſecond man in the world; but Chriſt is the Second man; that is, the Head of a ſecond Covenant, the Second man that God did enter into the Covenant withal for other men, and in that ſenſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was the ſecond man: As in the ſame ſenſe <hi>Adam</hi> is Called the firſt man ſo that God is Reconciled to the world in Chriſt; that is, as in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Breach was made between God, and man: ſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46564:55"/> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> Reconciliation is made between God, and man. And as God imputeth that which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did, to his Poſterity for Condemnation: ſo that which the Second <hi>Adam</hi> did, he doth impute to the Poſterity of that Second <hi>Adam</hi> for life, and Reconciliation.

                  <p>Firſt, Hence it followeth, that the Reconciliation of the Children of men with God, is a very great and deep myſtery, it is not a thing that can ordinarily be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it is not a thing that is wrought in a natural way. But to reconcile any ſoul unto God, is done in a way that is moſt deep, and hidden, and is (of it ſelf) a moſt glorious Myſtery. And therefore when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of our Reconciliation with God in Jeſus Chriſt; it tels us, that it is the hidden Wiſdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>We ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; even the hidden Wiſdome which God ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the World to our glory.</hi> It ſpeaks of the very ſame thing, that my Text ſpeaks of; viz. <hi>That God was Reconciling the world to hemſelf in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and this he ſaith was the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery the hidden Wiſdom which God ordeined before the world to our glory.

                  <p>The Second is this. Hence our Reconciliation with God is very free, it is a work of free grace; it is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf in Chriſt; it is not reconciling himſelf to us: for what we do our ſelves, or for what we can do; No, there is nothing that we do, or can do, nothing that Angels do or can do for us, that can reconcile us unto God, but we are reconciled unto God in Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the work of Reconciliation of us is nothing but free grace, we do not contribute any thing at al unto this great work, it is al done in Chriſt; it is altogether free.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46564:56"/> there be anything required of us, yet it muſt be God and Chriſt that muſt work it; all, every thing of our Reconciliation (whatſoever particular there is in it) it is al in Chriſt, and therefore altogether free Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; Chriſt is the guift of God, and every thing that is indeed in him, and by him, is a free guift to us. That is the Second thing that may be ſaid of this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, that it is free.</p>

                  <p>The third thing that may be ſaid of it, is this; That it is ſure and certain, there is a certainty, a ſureneſs of this Reconciliation; Why? Becauſe God hath wrought ſo ſtrangly about the work, and he would never work ſo ſtrangely about ſuch a work but he would have it come to ſomwhat; he would not have this work (after he hath done all) to vaniſh. Thoſe indeed that hold the Doctrine of free wil, and ſay, that indeed there is a price payd upon condition if we do beleeve, but we are left to our ſelves, either to beleeve or not beleeve, and God onely propouds the means; What do they teach but thus much? That after al the Councels of God that are wrought for our Reconciliation, and after thoſe great things which God hath done for us in Chriſt, it is in the power of man to make al to be void and of none effect, and that there ſhould not be any one man in the world reconciled at laſt; for ir muſt needs follow, that if it be left to man to beleeve or not to beleeve, and that it is in his power whether he wil or not; then it is in his power likewiſe to make al the Councels of God, and the great works of God in Chriſt to be of none effect at al; that after God hath from al eternity plotted the work, and ſent his own Son into the world to be made a Curſe for the ſin of man, to die &amp; to make al that ado, &amp; al that work about the matter of Reconciliation, &amp; Atonement; yet, (if that Doctrine were true which is a Belzebub error a falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46564:57"/> of the greateſt magnitude) it had been poſſible, hat (notwithſtanding the doing of al this) all had een loſt, and Chriſt might have dyed in vain, and not one ſoul in the world ſaved; I ſay this muſt needs follow upon that Doctrine. But now if that we hear that there is ſo much done, as there is for the making up of our peace &amp; Reconciliation with God; then on the other ſide, this muſt neceſſarily follow, &amp; certainly be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, that there are ſome that are to be reconciled to God, and that this work ſhal never be loſt; God wil never plot ſo great a work, and ſend his Son into the world to do ſo much as he did for the ſin of man, and at laſt ſuffer it al to be loſt; but he wil certainly bring ſome unto ſalvation. I confeſſe, when a poor ſinner, that is made ſenſible of what ſin is, and of the Breach that ſin hath made between him, and God; when he thinks of the greatneſs of the work, what it is to be reconciled unto God, he trembles, and ſhaketh in hmſelf, fearing it were to good news to be true, and leaſt it were not certain and ſure. Yea, but when he comes to underſtand what God hath done for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that work, how God not only hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it; but we can ſay now, that it is done, that the Lord hath indeed ſent his Son into the world and that he is made man, and that he hath been under the Curſe of God for mans ſin, and he hath been C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as when <hi>Jacob</hi> heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> his Son (whom he loved) was yet alive, the Text ſaith, the heart of the old man failed, he did not beleeve it, he thought it was two good to be true; But when his other Somes came and ſhewed him the Charriots that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent, and gave
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46564:57"/> him ſuch real demonſtration of the thing; not only that he was a live, but that he was the greateſt man in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and next unto <hi>Pharoah</hi> himſelfe; then the text ſaith; <hi>that the Spirit of</hi> Jacob <hi>revived, and he ſaid, is</hi> Joſeph <hi>my ſone a live?</hi> I <hi>have enough:</hi> So when a Siner that comes to be made ſenſible of the evil of ſin, and the greatnes, and widenes of that Breath that is between God and him; when he comes and hears one preach of the Doctrine of Reconciliation, and of Attonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul, and how that al his Sins may be pardoned, and God may become an intire frind unto him, and he come to be ſaved, and glorified eternally in the higeſt Heavens: The hearts of a poore Sinner beginns to fail; but when he can tel him what great things God hath done to bring this work about; that God hath in his infinite wiſdome found out ſuch a glorious way for reconciliation, that he hath ſent his ſon, and he is become man, and hath been under the wrath of his father, and Satisfied for mans Sin, and died, and ſhed his blood, and is now aſſended into Heaven, and is at the right hand of the Father, and an Advocate, and an interſceſſor; upon this, the ſinner may come to beleeve that there is a reallity in the thing, a Certainty in this worke of reconciliation. My Brethren, the work of reconciliation, is a Sure thing indeed: it is not a notion, fancy, or an imagination, but there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. and a certainty in it; and al this follows from hence; that it is <hi>[in Chriſt:]</hi> we could never be ſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the thing, except we had theſe real demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods heart towrads us. Suppoſe God had ſent an Angel from Heaven to preach to the Children of men the Doctrin of reconciliation, and to tel them, that God was wiling to be reconcilied unto them; alas, this could never be made out to be ſo Certain unto them; but ſtil the hearts of poore Siners would have been afraid, and would have thought, ſurly whatſoever is ſaid unto us, is but a little to quiet us for the preſent; certainly the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46564:58"/> mater is not ſo, as it is declared unto us, this would not have been ſo certain, though an Angel from Heaven had declared it; but when God ſhal pleaſe to give this evidence to us of his heart being towards us, and of his willingnes to be reconciled unto us, that he hath wrought ſo ſtrangly for us in ſending the ſecond Perſon in trinity to be made man, and him to do thus, and thus to worke out this work of Reconciliation: Upon this we may come certainly to conclude: that the heart of God is real in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k. In <hi>Rom:</hi> 4.16. we have an expreſſion to this purpoſe; therefore it is of faith ſaith the Apoſtle: it is: what is that? that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life and peace; for of that the Apoſtle is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that place: It is of faith; why? <hi>that it might be by greace,</hi> ſo the end the promiſe might be ſure. Mark here theſe two properties of our reconciliation with God, Wee are reconciled in Chriſt. Upon that, firſt it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is a great miſtry. And then ſecondly, that therfore it is free; [therfore] (ſaith he) it is of faith that it might be free. It is of faith; as if he ſhould ſay; it is from God in Chriſt; for faith doth relate alwaies unto Chriſt: It is of faith; that is of faith in Chriſt: that it might be by greace. as if it had not been by faith; if it were by any works that we ſhould do, then it were not free; it were not by grace; but it is by faith in Chriſt, that it might be by grace. And then ſecondly: it is of faith in Chriſt, to the end that the promiſe might be ſure you wil ſay: would it not be ſuer though it had not been by faith? ſuppoſe God had only ſent an Angel (as I hinted before) would it not have been ſure? No, not ſo ſure as now it is; for in that it is by faith upon Chriſt, we have Chriſt to pitch upon as the Object of our faith for our reconciliation with God, and by that it coms to be more ſure then it cold be by any other way. We cannot conceive that it were poſſible for the Lord by any way to reveale the reallity of his heart, and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his work in reconciling the world to himſelf ſo as by this means, in that he hath reavled it to be in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46564:58"/> Chirſt. And that is the Third thing that follows from it.</p>

                  <p>The Fourth thing from thence is this. That if it be in Chriſt, then as it is ſure; ſo it is full. Indeed were it in any other way that God did reveal Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to us then in Chriſt, we might be afraid that there were ſomething in the heart of God againſt it, that the heart of God did not fully cloſe with us, &amp; to be fully Reconciled with us: but when we hear what God hath done to Reconcile us to himſelf; what a price he hath paid for it, what coſt he hath been at to accompliſh it, and that his own Son hath undertaken to bring us and the Father together, and ſo to make up this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; then we may conclude it a full, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Reconciliation. Jeſus Chriſt would never undertake ſuch a work, but he would Compleat it, and he hath Compleated it; and therefore when you hear this word of the Goſpel that we are Reconciled to God in Chriſt, we may conclude, that the work is a ful, and a compleat work, becauſe it is done in him. That is another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                  <p>Further, if the Reconciliation we have with God be in Chriſt: hence in the Fifth place it follows, that God is Reconciled unto man upon very honorable tearms, it is an honorable Reconciliation, for it is ſuch a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation wherein God ſuffers nothing at all, but he hath all made up. If God had come, and only paſſed by our offences, and ſo had been reconciled to us without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ado, the Devils perhaps might have cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and have ſaid: Where is the glory of thy Juſtice? theſe have ſinned againſt thee as wel as we, and the Breach they have made upon thy Juſtice is no way made up; thou haſt been by them diſhonored, and that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46564:59"/> diſhonor that thou haſt receivd by them is no way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. But now, Man being reconciled to God in Chriſt; none of the Devils in Hell can ſpeak againſt Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or againſt his Righteouſneſs; for as God is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, ſo he is Reonciled upon honorable tearms. Indeed a man that hath an inferior who hath offended him, when he can ſee no other way to help himſelf; but that he muſt put up al the wrong, and injury that hath bin done him. It is a far different thing, then to be reconciled to the party offending upon honorable terms; for if he could come to have this wrong made up again, and not only he that hath offended come to ſubmit himſelf to him but all the injury that he hath done him fully ſatisfied; this were honorable. So is the Reconciliation between God and us, it is ſo honorable a Reconciliation, that it wil be the glory of God before the Angels, and Saints to al Eternity and it is that which God doth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in, as being exceedingly pleaſed with it, ſeeing his honor is made up in this Reconciliation. That is a fifth <hi>Conſequence</hi> from hence.</p>

                  <p>Sixtly: Followeth this; If we be reconciled to God in Chriſt, Hence our Reconciliation is in ſuch a way as doth altogether debaſe man; and though it be upon honorable tearms; yet it is in a way, wherein man hath no cauſe to glory in himſelfe: It is the greateſt way for the lowing, and humbling of man that poſibly can be there could be no way deviſed, wherein man ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, and yet be abaſed ſo much, as he is in this way of Reconciliation, when he truly Conſidereth it. For it is true, we are reconciled, but how? we began it not our ſelves, we did nothing in it our ſelves, al was done by Chriſt: therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>where is bouſting? It is excluded; by what Law? of works? no, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46564:59"/> (indeed) hath done great things for us, but al that which is done for us, is not thankworthy to our ſelves; it was al done without us. God was <hi>[in Chriſt] Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world, to himſelfe;</hi> and therfore though it is in honorable tearms (in reſpect of God) yet, when we ſeriouſly Conſider of it, we have ground, and Cauſe ſufficient to be abaſed in our ſelves; even to the very duſt. And then.</p>

                  <p>Yet further. Our Reconciliation being in Chriſt; Hence it follows: That it is a moſt firme, and laſting Reconciliation, an everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; as it is in Chriſt, here is the ground of the Everlaſtingneſs of it; Hence it is, that there is nothing can make a Breach again between God, and us, ſo as we ſhould become Enimies againe unto him; ſo that when we underſtand this Reconciliation with theſe properties, and Conſequences; then we underſtand aright what it is to be Reconciled unto God.</p>

                  <p>There is one Conſequence or poperty mor of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation that I muſt ad to what I mentioned before. And that is this. That if it be in Chriſt that we are Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God. Then certainly the work of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is a very difficult work; it is a mighty hard thing; Heaven, and Earth muſt be moved before this can be done, and God even ſhakes the Heaven and the Earth in this work. It was the difficulteſt work that ever God himſelf undertooke; and the difficulteſt work the Son undertook; for when he undertook it; you find that he did ſweat at it, and before he had done it, it coſt him his very hearts blood; therefore it was not an ordinary and ſlight work to reconcile God &amp; man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46564:60"/> together, but a moſt difficult work, becauſe it was in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe in this way the Father glorified his Son; had it not been for this way of Attonement, we had but little underſtood the glory of the ſecond Perſon in Trinity. No, nor indeed of the Third Perſon; nor the diſtinction of the Perſons: and therefore, before the Goſpel came to be made known to the Sons of men, the diſtinction of the Perſons in Trinity was very little made known: And in thoſe places wherein the Goſpel is not revealed, and made known; there is nothing fully known of the diſtinction of the Perſons in the Trinity. Now for the glory of the Trinity, and more eſpecially for the glory of the ſecond Perſon, the Son of God (who is the ſpecial Perſon in the work of Reconciation) hath God choſen this way of Reonciliation. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Third Perſon, and the Spirit, is ſent by Chriſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46564:60"/> and in the Conſummation of the work of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the glory of that Perſon appears; but the main weight of the work lies upon the Son, and for the glory of the Son of God hath he appointed this way to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the world. And indeed it is ſuch a work, as the Son himſelf doth exceedingly glory in, and accounts this to be a great part of his glory, that he is appointed by God the Father to be the Mediator, to reconcile God and man together. I beſech you obſerve this; this work of Reconcilation betweene God and us, it is that which Chriſt himſelf doth glory in, and it is that; which he counteth next unto the glory that he hath Perſonally with the Father, as he is generated of him from all Eternity: next unto that, Jeſus Chriſt glories in this; that he is appointed to be a Mediator between the Father, &amp; ſinful man. And that Chriſt himſelf doth glory in this work, I wil give you a Scripture, or two to prove it. That place which we have in the 13. <hi>John,</hi> 31. is remarkable for this. <hi>Therefore when he was gone out, Jeſus ſaid; Now is the Son of man Glorified &amp; God is glorified in him.</hi> Glorified now, When? It was when Judas betrayed him. and when he was going to ſhed his blood, and to die for the ſin of man, and to Compleat and Perfect this work of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Reconciliation; Now (ſaith he) <hi>is the Son of man Glorified:</hi> as if ſo be he ſhould have ſaid; I was indeed deſigned by the Father from all Eternity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this work of Reconciliation, and I came into the world for this very end, that I might do it, and all this while I have been a doing of it in a way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the main work is ſtil behind for me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, and perfect this work of Reconciliotion; but now it is at hand; Now I am going to die, and this my death wil bring an end to the work, and now (ſaith he) is the Son of man glorified; yea, here is the glory that I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from al Eternity; this is the glory that I rejoyced in when I was in the Boſome of the Father; for then I knew of this; I knew I was appointed to be a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46564:61"/> I knew it would coſt me my Blood when I ſhould come to compleat that work, and now the time is come when it is to be performed: and therefore now the Son of man is glorified. I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt accounteth it his glory that he is appointed to ſtand as a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and us. And therefore you ſhal find, that when the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts being appointed for this work by God; that he rejoyced in it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Sacrifices, and Offerings thou dideſt not deſire, mine eares haſt thou opened: burnt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Sin Offerings thou haſt not required; then ſaid</hi> I, <hi>Lo I come, mine eares</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haſt thou opened:</hi> what is that which God ſpak to him, unto which his eare was opened? That which God the Father ſpake to him, was this: Son; the work of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between my ſelfe, and ſinful man, I have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deſigned you to it; I have appointed you to go to be a Mediator between us, and to undertake to make Satisfaction; and ſuch ſatisfaction, as that ſinful man, and I may be at peace; as that Mercy, and Juſtice may be Reconciled together. For let me tel you, (as I have hinted before) God, and we could never have been reconciled, except Mercy, and Juſtice had been reconciled. Now God the Father tells Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath appointed him to this work. And ſaith Chriſt; my eare haſt thou opened: O, I do entertaine this worke and entertaine this gladly; yea, though I know that I muſt be made a Sacrifice for the ſin of man. And obſerve what follows in verſ, 7. <hi>then ſaid</hi> I; <hi>Lo</hi> I <hi>come;</hi> I am ready, and willing to do this work, <hi>for in the volum of the Book it is written, that</hi> I <hi>ſhould do thy wil:</hi> that is; in the Scriptures it was written before ever Chriſt came into the world, that he ſhould come to perfect this great work. And verſe 8. I <hi>delight to do thy wil O Lord yea, thy Law is in my heart.</hi> What was this wil of God? Certainly this wil of God here ſpoken of; was that Chriſt ſhould be a Mediator between God and man; and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46564:61"/> to make up this Reconciliation; and O, ſaith he, I do even delight to do this wil of thine, though it be a wil which wil coſt me deare. And ſaith he, thy Law; this Law that requires of me to come thus to be a Sacrifice, and to ſhed my blood to the end that I may be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between man, and God; even this Law, it is with in my heart. This is one Reaſon why God Choſe this way of Reconciling himſelf to the world; becauſe it tended to the glorifying of his Son, and his Son acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it, that it was his glory: and therefore juſt when he was going to die, he breaketh out into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A ſecond Reaſon why God would have this way of Reconciling man to himſelf, is. Becauſe, in this way the Father himſelf is moſt glorified; the Attributes of God do ſhine in a greater luſter in this way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, then if ſo be God had been reconciled unto man only in paſſing by the offence, and ſo no more to do; for now ſhines forth the glory of his Wiſdom, of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and of his Juſtice, as wel as of his mercy; not only mercy, but the other divine Attributes of God ſhine in this way of Reconciliation exceedingly bright; and there is no ſuch Glaſs to behold the glory of God in as the glory of the Goſpel in the Miſtery of Reconciliation. We indeed behold and ſee the glory of God in the Glaſs of the Creatures; But in the Goſpel, in the work of Reconciliation in Chriſt, there is the bright Glaſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in al the beams of the glory of Gods Attributes are vnited together, and ſhine with a Tranſcendent luſter. Yea, there is not only a luſter, and a ſhining forth of them, but a heat, and a warmth that is reflected in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46564:62"/> of them. In this way of Reconciliation God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is glorified; and therefore that Text which I named <hi>John,</hi> 13.31. You have this likewiſe ſaid; that as Chriſt acknowledged himſelf to be glorified by this work; ſo ſaith he, <hi>my Father is glorified in me;</hi> and therefore in Chapter, 17.

                     <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 3.</head>
                  <p>A third Reaſon is this: Becauſe the Lord ſaw that there was no ſuch way to melt the heart of ſinful Creatures, and to draw them to come, and cloſe with himſelf, as this way; no ſuch way to incorrage the hearts of poor ſinners to come in to be reconciled unto God as this; even the Conſideration of the great things that the Lord hath done to make peace and Reconciliation between himſelf and ſinners. God (I ſay) foreſaw this; and becauſe he would have a way to break the hardeſt heart in the world, and to draw the moſt ſtout, and ſtubbarne ſinner unto himſelf; therefore he hath choſen this way above al others of Reconciliation. This the Goſpel tels us in that parrable wherein you have the letting out of the Vineyard unto Husbandmen; and it tels you when the Maſter ſent one ſervant and they beat him; and he ſent an other, and they beate him; and at length he ſaid within himſelf, I wil ſend my Son,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46564:62"/> ſurely they wil reverence him; as if he ſhould have ſaid; Here are a company of hard hearted, ſtubbarn, ſtout, wicked creatures in this world, and they have had this argument, and the other argument to work upon theire hearts to perſwade them to come unto me, but ſo hard are their hearts, as that they give a rebound to al the arguments that they have; and there is nothing ſtrikes into their hard hearts, there is nothing melts them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perſwades them to come unto me, But I have one argument more, and that ſhal break the ſtouteſt, and hardeſt heart that is; and that argument ſhal be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing argument if they be thoſe that are appointed to life; if they be ſuch as are not loſt Creatures for ever, and what is that argument? even this; that I am recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling my ſelf to the world in my ſon; I wil ſend my Son into the world to work out this reconciliation; and there I wil reveale ſo much of my glory, that when they come to ſee this, O, their hearts ſhal be fil'd with admiration; they ſhal ſtand and wonder at the goodnes and riches of my grace, and their hearts ſhal melt before me, and ſhal at length be gained unto me. when they come to heare thereof Certaynly it is the moſt Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing in the world for the hearts of men not to be melted not to be gained upon with this Doctrin of our Reconciliation with God in Chriſt. And remember it; if your hearts when you come to hear of this Doctine be not gained upon, be not drawn unto God; it is a ſhrew'd argument that you are loſt Creatures; for God himſelfe looks upon this way of reconciliation as the moſt gaining and prevaling argument that poſibly he can uſe to gaine the heart of any man. And except you finde your hearts gained upon by this, you may take it as an argument of a moſt dangerous Condition in which you are. I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to thoſe whoſe harts God hath gained to himſelfe, let them Say, what was it that gained their hearts, what was it that broke their hearts moſt kindly at firſt and Cauſed them to fly unto God; was it not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46564:63"/> of this miſtery of Reconciliation in Chriſt, was it not Gods tender of his mercy to the ſouls of poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures in Chriſt, And woe to thoſe Perſons that ſhal Sit under the miniſtry of the Goſpel the droppings of heaven and here the bleſed tidings of Reconciliation in Chriſt, and yet not find their hearts gained by this argument; for this was one ſpecial end why God thoſe this way of Reconciling himſelf to the world, that he might by this gaine the hearts of the Children of men to himſelfe for ever.</p>
                  <p>So that now you have had al theſe things opened in the point beſides the proof of it in Scripture. firſt you have had ſhewed unto you, that there cold be no Reconciliation but in Chriſt. ſecondly; That Chriſt was a fit mediator to reconcile God and us together; and in what particular. thirdly what Chriſt hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to do for the Reconciliation of us to God, and what he doth to this very day. Fourthly how we com to have Intereſt in what he hath done for our Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. fiftly the ſeveral properties, or conſequences of this Reconciliation which doth diſcover to us what a kinde of Reconciliation it is. And then the Reaſons why God would reconcile the world to himſelf in this way rather then in any other way.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. then from this point; that God was in Chriſt Reconciling the world to himſelfe. Hence is preſented before us the woful miſery that ſin hath brought us into. There is nothing that ſets out the Breach between God and man ſo much as this. That the making up of that Breach muſt be in Chriſt. There is a great queſtion now on foot. Whether humiliation be neceſſary or no; whether men muſt be made ſenſſible of their natural condition, and ſo be humbled, and that way be brought unto Jeſus Chriſt. There are a great many that Catch hold upon the abuſe of this Humiliation ſo as wholly to exclude it (but exceeding ignorantly) becauſe that ſome would make humiliation as if it were a Condition of the Covenant, which indeed it is not; and when they heare us ſay, that it is not a Condition; they preſently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is no need at al of it; becauſe ſay they, Humiliation doth not at al intereſt us in Jeſus Chriſt. And becauſe ſome perhaps wil truſt two much in their Humiliation, and rely upon it, therefore others wil wholly take it away, and exclude it. But: though humiliation is not the Condition of the Covenant, though it is not that which doth give us an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; though it is not that which we are to rely upon; yet there is very much need of humiliation, and that we be made ſenſible of our loſt Condition by ſin; and by that which hath been delivered you may ſee a neceſſity of it: for Conſider; I ſuppoſe if you beleive that God wil pardon your ſins, and that he wil be Reconciled
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46564:64"/> unto you, you beleive it is in Chriſt: Yea, you wil ſay, that is Certaine; and therefore ſeeing Chriſt hath wrought our Reconciliation what need we be humbled for ſin. Certainly my Bretheren in that which you ſay, if you underſtand what you ſay, there is implied the deepeſt work of humiliation, and the ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereunto that it is poſſible for any Creature to be Capable of in this world. How is that, you wil ſay? Thus. I beleeve that God is reconciled to me in Chriſt; what? hath God wrought my reconciliation in his Son? hath he brought it about by Jeſus Chriſt? and choſen that way above all other wayes to do it? Then certainly ſuch was the Breach between God and me through my ſin that al the Angels in Heaven, and al the men in the world could never make it up. Such was the Breach that my ſin had made between God and my ſoul as it is required ſo great a miſtery of Godlineſs to make it up, as the very Angels themſelves are not able to comprehend. And indeed it is the greateſt work that ever God did do, or that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver God wil do to al Eternity. Conſider what it coſt to make up the Breach that ſin had made between God and thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>And againe; If you beleive that you are reconciled to God in Chriſt; you do not only ſee and are Convinced of the greatneſs of that Breach, but you muſt be ſenſible of it too; for can I go out of my ſelf, and exerciſe ſuch a gloriouſe act of Faith upon Chriſt as Mediator, and yet not be ſenſible of what Chriſt hath done? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the work of faith can never be raiſed in the heart, But it is raiſed ſo as the ſinner knows what he doth when he doth beleive, and is ſenſible of what he doth. And if this be ſo; take but theſe two things. That when a man beleeves in Chriſt as Mediator, that he knows what he doth; when he beleeves, and is ſenſible of what he doth; take but theſe two things for granted, and I wil warrant that foul wil be humbled; it follows of it ſelf, and of its own nature; it need not be required as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46564:64"/> it is as neceſſary to the work of faith as light in the Sun when it ſhines, or as heate of the fire, and indeed it is implyed. As for example. When I am to go to ſuch a place, or about ſuch a buſineſs; it is true, going is not the condition required; it is not required that I ſhould travil ſo many ſtepps by way of Condition, but that ſuch an act ſhould be performed; that I ſhould be at ſuch a place at ſuch a day to do ſuch a buſineſs; now though this be not expreſſed in a condition, that I muſt go ſo many miles, and the going of the miles is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as the other; and though that be not required yet it is implyed in the act that is required; and it is to be looked upon as neceſſary, as that which is required as a Condition. So, it is true, humiliation is not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſecond Covenant, it is not the thing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſteth us in Jeſus Chriſt, but it is that which the nature of faith doth neceſſarily imply; for faith is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Grace; and indeed it is the moſt gloriouſe worke of the ſoul that ever was: for a ſoul to beleeve in God through Chriſt; to beleeve that God is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him in Chriſt it is the moſt glorious work under heaven</p>
                  <p>Now when I beleeve in Chriſt as a Savior; what is he a Savior from? a Savior from my ſin, a Savior from the wrath of God, and this the Soul muſt neceſarily be ſenſſible of, how elſe can it put forth ſuch an act of Faith; and I know no faithful preacher in the world that ever preſſed humiliation further then this; that when men beleeve in Chriſt, they muſt know, and be ſenſible of what they do; you muſt know Chriſt is a Mediator, and if he be a Mediator, what is he a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for? why, to make up a Breach between God, and you. And then you muſt know what that breach is; that is, the breach that your ſin hath made. And then you muſt know what ſin that is; Namely, that your ſin hath provoked the Juſtice of God, and put you under the Curſe of the Law. So that you ſee the neceſſity of opening the law, though it be not a thing which intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46564:65"/> us in Chriſt, yet it follows of it ſelf as a neceſſary Conſequence without which you cannot underſtand Chriſt as a reconciler. This is therefore the firſt uſe If God wil never be reconciled to any Soul but only in Chriſt; then that Soul that comes to be Saved muſt come to ſee it ſelf in a moſt woful Condition; for ſuch a Creature as hath need of ſuch a Mediator muſt needs be in a moſt Wretched, Damnable, Miſſerable, Curſed condition in it ſelf, for elſe it could never requier ſuch a Mediator. And certainly there is no ſuch way to honor Chriſt as this. When men ſpeake of Chriſt, and of free Grace, except rhey inſtruct people in this; Namely the breach that is made between God, and them through ſin; how can any of their Avditory underſtand what Chriſt is. Chriſt is a Mediator; what to do? to ſave from fin, What? from what ſin? from ſin. What is that? ſin muſt be made known if Chriſt be the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler between God, and us; becauſe Reconciliation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a breach, and a breach that is made by ſin, and if you know not what breach is that is made, how can you honor Chriſt as Mediator? So that you muſt know what that breach is: that breach is the enmity that is in your hearts by Nature; you muſt know what that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is, and be ſenſible of it, or elſe you can never give glory to God in Chriſt. And though many have ſo much in their mouthes of Chriſt, and of free Grace; yet it is apparent in their Courſe that they do not give glory to Chriſt; Chriſt hath little cauſe to thank them for any glory that he hath from them in their Converſation; they rather blott, and ſtaine the name of Chriſt: and what is the reaſon? The truth is, they never rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Chriſt as a Mediator; they never knew what it was to have need of a Mediator between God, and them, and ſo they having but a ſuperficial knowledg of Chriſt; Chriſt hath but a ſuperficial glory from them. That is the firſt Uſe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 IF God hath reconciled himſelf to the world in Chriſt. Hence we are to take notice of the great miſtakes there are in the world in the point of Reconciliation with God. Certainly if this be a truth; that the only way of making up our peace with God is in Chriſt; then the world doth gennerally miſtake in the great matter of Reconciliation with God; and a miſtake, in this, is an undoing miſtake, a damning miſtake; a Soul may periſh eternally meerly thorugh a miſtake in the matter of Reconciliation. A man may be troubled for ſin, and cry out of his ſin, and may break off the practice of his ſin, and cry unto God in Prayer that he would pardon him, and be reconciled unto him, and yet miſtaking here, and not underſtanding that it muſt be God, in, and through Chriſt that reconcileth himſelf: the miſtake in this may prove an undoing miſtake to that Soul; and although they ſhould be Crying out of their ſins al their daies, they may periſh at laſt if they do not know, and rightly underſtand how to cloſe with Gods mercy as it is in Chriſt: if they do not underſtand, that it is God in Chriſt that reconcileth himſelf to the world. We know the greateſt part of people look for their Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God meerly in a natural way; they have ſinned againſt him, and they wil cry unto him for mercy, and for pardon, and ſo they think al may be made up between God and them. I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath a notable ſpeech concering this in his meditation about the way which God hath appointed for reconciling of man to himſelf, that it is in Chriſt. <hi>It is intollerahle
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46564:66"/> and horrible blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, when God by ſuch a way hath appointed Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, for a man to neglect this, and to think, that any work of his own ſhal pacify God; eſpecially thoſe that heare the Goſpel preached to them, when they ſhal think of any other way of their own, and ſo neglect the way that God hath appointed this is indeed a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, and horrible blaſphemy: and Certainly it is that which provoketh the Lord exceedingly; that when a ſinner ſhal be made apprehenſive and ſenſible of the Breach that is made between God and him; for that ſinner to think the Breach to be no greater then may be made up with any work of Repentance, or good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or good works; the Lord diſclaineth to look upon that ſinner in this his folly; that a man ſhould think that the Breach between God, and him is a matter of no greater moment. No, my Brethren, you muſt know, that the Breach between God, and you by ſin, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of another manner of Conſequence then can be made up by prayers, or feares, or any thing elſe that you can do al this is untempred Morter. It is true, when there is Repennance, and turning unto God, it is a good ſigne that God is at work with your hearts; but that cannot
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46564:66"/> do the deed; it is in Chriſt; it is the blood of the Son of God that muſt make Satisfaction for ſin; it is that which muſt make the Reconciliation. This is that which is indeed the great doctrine of the Goſpel; and til you receive this into your underſtandings, into your hearts al other things that we preach are to no purpoſe at al, it wil never do you good, till you have imbraced this, you wil never Sanctify Gods name, nor gloryfy God in your Converſations, nor have any true peace within your doores, til you come to receive this point into your hearts; that God is in Chriſt Reconciling the world to himſelfe. Take heed therefore of any miſtakes in this point. That is the ſecond Uſe.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe. 3.</hi> To encourage ſinners to come to God for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: And diſcouragements removed.</head>
                  <p>The Third is a Uſe of incouragement to ſinners to come for Reconciliation with God. You may remember that one Reaſon why God did on purpoſe appoint this way to Reconcile himſelf to the world, was, that he might break the hearts of ſinners, and that it might be an encouragement to ſinners to come in, Is this Gods End? O! that then God might have this end in your ſouls This hath bin our endeavor to open what we could, this Doctrine of the Goſpel, namely, of Gods Reconciling of himſelf in Chriſt; and we have not done this only from this Text but from others: and though divers other things have been ſpoken, yet you cannot but know, that the drift of al hath bin to this purpoſe, that God may have this glory of gaining our hearts to himſelf, and that it might be an incouragement unto you to come in to be reconciled unto God. Are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46564:67"/> there any that are apprehenſive of the Breach that ſin hath made between God and their ſouls? I ſuppoſe there are many. You put up papers of complaints of the hardneſs of your hearts and that you cannot be ſenſible of ſin as you deſire; it is a ſign that there is ſome ſenſibleneſs therefore of the breach between God and you. Now the Lord in opening of this Doctrine propounds the way of Reconciliation, and he would fain draw your hearts to come in and to be reconciled unto him; what is it that hinders? Theſe two things are the Only hinderance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The great diſtance that is between God, and a Creature; I am a poor vile worm, and the Lord is an infinite, glorious, dreadful God. O! but that I might take off this dreadfulneſs from you, that that might not skare, and hinder you, therefore he propounds himſelf to you in his Son. If God ſhould indeed ſpeak from Heaven by thundring, and lightening, and call in ſinners to come in and humble your ſelves, and ſeek to make your peace with him, that might skare you, and upon the ſight of the diſtance between God and you, you might not dare to come in. But ſaith God; I call you now in my Son, my Son that came to be like one of you, and to be made ſenſible of your infirmites, it is in him that I offer you Reconciliation. This takes away the dreadfulneſs of God from ſinners, and therefore a mighty incouragement. And though there be ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between God and us, yet there is a Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the Father, and us. Though we be the pooreſt worms in the world, though we are mean, and vile Creatures, yet if we were ten thouſand times meaner then we are, ſeeing there is ſuch a Mediator between God, and us; this makes up the diſtance. Chriſt is ſuch a Mediator as there is enough in him to make up all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that can be between God, and man.</p>
                  <p>Another hinderance, or diſcouragement is ſin: either the greatneſs of our ſin, or the multitude of our ſins, or the long continuance in our ſins is that which hinders
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46564:67"/> us from comming. O! ſaith the ſoul, I have been ſo vile a ſinner, and I have continued ſo long, and I have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied ſin one after another, and is it poſſible for ſuch a one as I am to be Reconciled? It is true had'ſt thou to deal only with God as he is in himſelf, thou mighteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire: But know O! ſinner that it is God Reconciling of himſelf in Chriſt; therefore though thou beeſt a great ſinner, &amp; a ſinner of a long continuance; yet there being a Reconciliation with God in his Son; ſeeing that Chriſt hath undertaken ſuch a work as to make up a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and ſinners, and to mediate for them; thou may'ſt be encouraged to come in, and to lay hold upon this grace of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If thou ſayeſt thou art unworthy; and that there is no worthines in thee for God to regard the for. Al this is ſtil anſwered with this. It is God that is reconciling the world to himſelfe in Chriſt. Indeed were it ſo that there were nothing but God and thee to deal together; and if thou wert to deal only with God, himſelfe thou mighteſt be afraid but thou haſt to deal with God not in himſelf win his Son, for ſo he hath Set forth himſelfe the to world, he is reconciled to the world in his ſon, and herefore that may incorage thee notwithſtanding al thy unworthines.</p>
                  <p>And what Further haſt thou to diſcorage thee?</p>
                  <p>O! thou wilt ſay; God is infinitly Juſt to puniſh ſin.</p>
                  <p>Stil this point wilbe Sufficient to remove al diſcorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that he is Reconciling the world to himſelfe. Though he is Holy; his Holines is pleaſed in Chriſt: Though he is Juſt: his Juſtice is ſatisfied in Chriſt. So that there is enough in this point to take away al object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, to remove al diſcouragments that any Sinner in the world hath. And therefore as God doth propound this on purpoſe to draw ſinners to himſelfe that they may be reconciled unto him; So let them know; that the more grace here is received for the taking away of al objections, and diſcoragments; the more wil ſinners be left without excuſe another day if they do not come
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46564:68"/> in and lay hold upon this grace of God in Chriſt; God wil have his glory that way if he cannot have it the other. God primarily intends his glory in reconciling the world to himſelfe; and therefore takes away al diſcouragments from ſiners that they may come in and venture their ſouls upon his rich grace, and mercy in Chriſt; But if God cannot have his glory from that point; then, the more this is preached in any congregation, the more wil God have his glory by the ſtopping of mens mouthes that they ſhal not be able to ſay another day; O, the Lord was terrible, and he was a hard maſter, and I durſt not goe unto him. Indeede my Conſcience told me I had ſinned againſt him, but I durſt not goe to him for mercy for I was afraid of him. The mouthes of men ſhal be ſtopped another day that have heard this doctrine or God reconciling the world in Chriſt opened unto them, and have not come in, and layd hold upon it. Indeed it is the plea of many a ſervant that hath offended his maſter, when one comes to him and Saith; why do not you goe and humble your ſelf before your maſter. O, Saith he I dare not, he is ſuch a furiouſe man that he wil fly upon me preſently, I had rather ſuffer very much then go to him; and this they think excuſe enough; and many poor Servants wil rather wander up and down the Contry, and periſh, then go backe to their maſter? But noe ſinner can ſay ſo of God, let him be never ſo vild a ſiner that is departing from God, if one ſhould come unto him and ſay; you wreched ſinner whether are you going? you are departing from God, you are going away from him, but behold God calls you to come in; O, goe, and humble yor ſoules and lament your ſin, and lay downe al thoſe weapons of enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God which you have taken up. This ſinner now cannot ſay; how ſhal I dare to look upon God, I that have been ſuch a vild, and wretched Sinner, Surely God wil diſtroy me, and conſume me. No, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelfe to you, a God or mercy in his Son, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46564:68"/> tels you, that he hath provided a meanes in his Son to be reconciled unto you; and that his heart hath been ſo much upon reconciling himſelfe to the chrildren of men, as that he hath ſent his ſon to do this worke and though it coſt the very blood of his ſon, yet he wil do it; and therefore ſinner if thou doſt not come in, but wilt go on in wandring from God and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in wayes of enmity againſt him, thy blood be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine own head. Thou haſt read this bleſſed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel opened; that God was reconciling himſelfe to the world; and that he was reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elfe to the world in his Son; and that God excepted that when this meſſage was brought to a Congregation; the whole Congregation ſhould come and fly unto him; and that the world ſhould be fill'd with Cries; O! that we might be Reconciled unto him. Our Lotd expects this day from ſome of you to heare you reflect this upon your ſelves by crying unto him for Reconciliation in his Son; that ſhould be the iſſue of ſuch ſermons as theſe are; God ever after ſuch preaching looks to heare ſome ſoul repeate in prayer to God, and tel him what it hath heard in the Miniſtery of the word; and upon that make a prayer unto him according to what it hath heard. As in this manner; The Lord expects that this day ſome ſinner, or other ſhould get alone, and be crying unto God in prayer. Lord, I have heard, not only that there is a poſſibility for ſinners to be Reconciled, but there is ſuch a glorious way of Reconciliation, that thou haſt done it in thy Son. Such an honorable way; and ſuch a certaine way of Reconciliation; and that thy heart is much in that way. And Lord I have heard, that this is a way, that takes away all objections in the world; al the diſcouragments that can be immagined; and thou haſt revealed it to that end, that is, that thou mighteſt break the hearts of ſinners, and draw them to come in, and accept of that bleſſed covenant that thou haſt tendred to them in Chriſt, and to be reconciled unto thee. Now Lord I deſire to caſt my ſoul upon
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46564:69"/> this free grace of thine in thy Son; O! that I might feel thy ſpirit inableing me to ſuch a gloriouſe work as this; and O! that the Lord might heare ſuch things as theſe from ſome of your Cloſets this day; it wil be that which wil even cauſe the heart of God to rejoyce that ever he opened the doctrine of Reconciliation to you; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it wil turne to the quite contrary end; it wil only ſerve to ſtop your mouthes at the great day. That is another Uſe.</p>

                  <p>YEt once more: If there be ſuch a way of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between God and us; if God hath wrought it ſo, that it is in Chriſt. Truly from hence we have no Cauſe to diſpaire in Gods power, and wiſdome, and goodneſs to make peace in this Nation; God hath done the greater work. You ſee that God is a God of peace and loves peace; and to the end that he might be at peace with the wretched Children of men, he hath wrought ſo wonderfully as to ſend his own Son into the world and provide ſuch a way that he may be ſure that peace may be made, and by that way he hath done it: He hath made peace between Mercy; and Juſtice; there is peace made between an infinite provoked God and wreatched ſinful vild Creatures. <hi>I</hi> told you before that this was a mighty difficult work; yea, the moſt difficult that ever was, or can be in the world. If God hath therefore wrought ſuch a work ſo difficult, in a way ſo gloriouſe. Then from hence learne not to diſpaire, but that God may worke even peace for us in this Nation, and an honorable peace, and a good peace too. We are not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46564:69"/> only hereby incouraged to cry unto God for peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and our Souls; but we are by this incouraged to cry unto him for peace in the Nation, and that he would put an end to theſe woful times of deſtruction, and miſery, and war which many of our Brethren have ſuffered, and bled under. And indeed thoſe that do underſtand, or have ever felt the work of God in working peace between his maieſty and their Souls, they are thoſe that have ſuch intreſt in God, as if any people, ſhal prevail with him for peace in the land, it muſt be theſe; they wil prove to be our peace makers in the concluſion, howſoever people at preſent cry out of them as if they were the means and inſtruments of making the grateſt debate, and as if they were the enimies of peace: No my Brethren, they that have experience of this great work of God, of making peace between himſelf, and their Souls, they are they that he at the Throne of grace continually crying unto him that is the prince of of peace to make peace in the Land.</p>
                  <p>We deſire peace. But you wil ſay; How can it be done that way? Why ſhould we ſay how? when God himſelf hath made peace between Heaven, and Earth. We ſee things ſo intricate, that we know not how it ſhould be done, and we wonder it ſhould ever be brought about, that the Spirits of men being ſo ſet one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other there ſhould be a Reconciliation: But God hath waies in his infinite Wiſdom that we are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the ſpirits of any of our Adverſaries are not ſo deſperately bent againſt us, but there was as much enmity between us, and God, as there can be betwixt us, and any of our adverſaries in the world: and we have no ſuch exaſperated enimes againſt us, as we were by nature againſt God. If therefore God could find a way when we were ſuch enimies unto him to make peace betwixt us; and him; then hath God likewiſe a way to make a true ſetled, and conſtant peace between our Adverſaries, and us: And we ſhould deſire; that as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46564:70"/> God hath made our peace with him firme, and ſure; ſo that what peace God makes in this land, it may be ſomwhat like unto that peace that he hath made between Heaven, and Earth. There is a firme peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and us, a peace that we may reſt upon, and confide in. A peace betwen our adverſaries, and us, (as things now ſtand) we cannot count it ſure; you cannot be ſure of your lives one night after it is done; as things now ſtand. But we muſt deſire ſuch a peace might be made, as there is made between God, and us; ſure, and firme, and ſtable. Therefore pray much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve much as you are able; and though things be brought to ſuch a ſtraite as there is no likelyhood in the thoughts of men how it ſhould be done; yet they are not brought to ſuch a ſtraite as things were between God, and us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reconciled himſelf unto us. And there was more required to make up that Reconciliation betwixt God, and us, then there can be between us, and our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And what was it that made our peace firſt with God? God was in Chriſt reconciling the world; it was the blood of his Son that ſaved our blood, and therefore let al thoſe that are godly go to this God of peace, and not only cry to him by Prayer for the making of a true, and firme peace amongſt us; but preſent unto him the blood of his Son to that end; and ſay; O Lord; thou that ſenteſt thy Son into the world to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Souls and thee; look upon that blood, and let that blood prevail with thee to make peace in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> that there may be no more of the precious blood of thy Saints ſpilt, and ſhed amongſt us. Here is the way to get peace. And Certainly if the blood of Chriſt were able to make ſuch a peace between us, and God as is firme, and laſting: it wil be able alſo to make peace in this poor Nation; and ſuch a peace as ſhal be firme, and laſting too.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are incouraged in regard of external condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in regard of the peace of our land; that ſeeing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46564:70"/> God hath done the greater, he is able much more to do the leſſer. That ſeeing God hath reconciled mercy, and Juſtice together, and made peace betwixt Heaven, and Earth, when the Breach was ſo great, as al the men in the world, and the Angels in Heaven could not find out a way to compoſe the difference, and make up that breach, yet he hath done it: He can certainly alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the differences, and make up the breach that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>

                  <p>HEnce then if our Reconciliation with God be ſuch as hath been opened, and if it be wrought after that way; Then an other Uſe we may make of it is this. Namely: That al thoſe that have any comfortable aſſurance that their peace is made with God, they are to priſe it highly, and not eaſily, and lightly to looſe the aſſurance of it; Why? Becauſe it hath coſt ſo much as it hath done, and it hath been wrought for them after ſuch a ſtrange manner as it hath been; the greateſt work that ever God made; and wherein his wiſdome, and goodneſs, and power hath been ſeen; now that which God hath ſet himſelfe to worke ſo powerfully in, to the end that he might acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it; and that which hath coſt ſo dear as it hath done; that wherein ſo much of the miſtery of Godlineſs is contained; ſuerly then if we have obtained the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it in our ſelves, we ſhould highly priſe it, and we ſhould ſeeke to preſerve it, and not looſe it; we know not how. I remember when we opened the excellency of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46564:71"/> our Reconciliation with God and, what admirable fruits did flow fom it; we had there a Uſe like unto this; that becauſe it is ſo excellent we ſhould preſerve it and not let it go lightly, But now this Uſe is drawn from the way of Reconciliation, that it is a Reconciliation in Chriſt; and in indeed the argument fals more ſtrongly upon us here then it did formerly, before, the argument was, that we ſhould priſe it becauſe we have ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our Reconciliation; becauſe ſuch admirable fruits doe flow from it; becauſe it is able to carry us through al troubles in the world. But now we muſt ſeek to preſerve it, becauſe we have it in Chriſt, becauſe it is that which coſt more then ten thouſand worldes are worth; becauſe God hath wrought ſo wonderfully to bring it ahout. Hath God therefore ſpoken peace to any of your ſouls? take heed that you turn not again to folly; <hi>Pſalm:</hi> 85.8. <hi>I wil hear what the Lord wil ſay, for he wil ſpeak peace to his people and to his Saints; but let not them return again to folly.</hi> Haſt thou gotten any comfortable perſwaſion that the Lord is reconciled unto them Chriſt; and God hath made thee to know that Reconciliation with him was a difficult work? it may be it coſt you many tears, and prayers, and much trouble before you could get it, and a long time you were ſeeking of it in a Legal way, and crying unto God for his mercy to pardon your ſins, and Seeking to him in that natural way; but then you could not have peace ſpoken to your hearts, but in time the Lord opened the miſtery of Chriſt unto your ſouls, and then you ſought Reconciliation with him in Chriſt, and you ſaw how that it was in his blood that your peace was made. Have you got peace in an Evangelical way through Chriſt? O! Make much of it; it is a precious Jewel in that it comes to you in ſuch a way as this is; it coſt God dear, and it may coſt you dear; but whether it coſt you dear or no; you may be ſure it coſt God dear, therfore make much of it, do not looſe it: to looſe it fully ſo as God ſhould

                  <p>When they ſhal through their weakneſs think that that ſin they fall into, or are overtaken with, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cauſe an enmity between God, and them. I make no queſtion but there are many ſouls that God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto, and ſomtimes have had ſome comfort in the aſſurance of this reconciliation, and yet if at any time they be but overcome with the ſinful diſtempers of their hearts, they preſently think, that this puts an enmity between God, and them again, and they begin to look upon God as upon their enemy, and think that all the peace is broken between God, and them, and this makes ſuch a Breach between God, and them, as that al that God hath done, is undone again, and now they think that God is againſt them in all his waies, and contrary
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46564:72"/> unto them as unto an enemy. It's true, Carnall hearts that do not underſtand what the difficulty is of making peace with God; or what a breach it is that ſin makes between God, and the ſoul; they can ſin, and ſin, and ſin, and yet think God wil be merciful to them ſtil, and never look upon their ſin as enmity unto God, or upon God as an enemy unto them in regard of their ſin. But take a poor ſoul that underſtands what ſin is, and hath found it a hard thing to make peace between God, and himſelf, as ſoon as any ſin overcomes ſuch a ſoul, the dayly weakneſſes many times make him think that God is an enemy to him; and however he had good hopes before, yet the breach is again as wide, if not wider between God, and him as ever it was. Now by this know, you do diſhonor much the great work of God in Chriſt in the point of Reconciliation. ſurely it is as great a diſhonor as you can caſt upon Chriſt; when he hath come to make Reconciliation between God, and you, and when he hath undertaken it, and done it ſo throughly as he hath; and when it coſt him his very life to do it, yet when you apprehend this Reconciliation to be no otherwiſe, but that upon any offence, you think al is undone again: truly this were but a very poor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Suppoſe two that were at ods one with another, and a great breach hath been made between them; another comes and reconciles theſe two for the preſent, but yet ſo as that the one ſhal watch the other, to take an advantage againſt the other, ſo as if there be but the leaſt offence committed, they ſhal be as great enemies one to another as before; this were but a poor Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So when you come to think, that upon every ſin you commit, after you have had your peace made between God and you, though you can appeal unto God in the ſincerity of your heart, that it is the greateſt burden in the world to you, that you do thus ſin againſt him, and you would think it the greateſt mercy in the world to be delivered from that body of ſin: yet, when you ſhal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46564:72"/> come to think, that upon this ſin you have committed, the breach is made as wide as ever it was with God; What a diſhonor do you put upon Chriſt? What a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation hath Chriſt made for you? O! therefore beleeve that Chriſt hath made another manner of peace with God then ſo; and know, that it is not a peace that can ſo ſoon be broken. If a Bone-ſetter ſhould ſet a Bone in your Body that were broken, or our of joynt, and ſet it ſo that it is right for the preſent; but yet ſo too, that if you ſtir your arm, or leg, it is out of joynt again; you wil conclude, this is no skilful Boneſetter. Chriſt came from Heaven for this very end, and purpoſe, that he might joyn God, and us together, that he might make us one with God. Do you think that Chriſt hath only ſet us ſo together, as that upon every dayly infirmity, we ſhould be out with God again? No, certainly he hath ſet us ſtrongly together, more ſtrongly then ever we were, Adam in Innocency, when he was without ſin, had not ſuch a ſtrong peace with God, as thou haſt in the mid'ſt of thy ſins. It is a truth; and though we cannot ſpeak of ſuch things without trembling, in regard we know how ready carnal hearts are to abuſe them; yet this is a truth, and ſo I would have Chriſtians to look upon it; to look upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation that is made between God, and them, as a peace firmer then ever it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> and God, though <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſin, and they have many ſins, for <hi>Adam</hi> had it not in Chriſt; and therefore think upon it as ſuch a Reconciliation as Chriſt hath wrought, and ſo honor God in it, and ſanctifie God in it. If indeed it were no other reconciliation then thou haſt got by thy own prayers, or then thou haſt got by thy own tears; then thou mighteſt feare, that, that reconciliation might be broken upon thy renewing of ſin. And the truth is; this is the ground why thoſe that have inlightned Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, are ſo ful of feares, and doubts; thoſe indeed that have no inlightnings in them, are without any feare
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46564:73"/> but the other are ful of doubts, and feares; and it is upon this ground; becauſe that peace they have, is no other but that which they have gotten by their Prayers, and by their duties, and by their teares, and by their good meanings, as they think, and never bring in Chriſt; they never have been acquaynted with that great Miſtery of Godlineſs. Now, that peace with God that thou haſt got any way but by Gods revealing the work of his reconciling himſelfe to the world in Chriſt; that peace wil never hold long; but thou wilt be ready upon every temptation, upon every ſuggeſtion; upon every new ſin committed, to cal that peace into queſtion: But if thou haſt been rooted in Chriſt, and thy peace grounded upon that which is beyond al thy duties, and al thy teares, and prayers, nnd canſt look upon God as reconciled unto thee in Chriſt; this peace wil hold, and this may hold notwithſtanding abundance of ſins may remaine in the ſoul of one that is thus recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God. And therfore for your help, becauſe you may not upon every ſin cal in queſtion your reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God: know this; that being reconciled unto God, thou art not under the Law ſo as that every ſin againſt the Law ſhould put thee under the ſentence, of eternal death: <hi>thou art not under the curſe that doth threaten everlaſting death to thoſe that ſo ſin. Here is the difference between one that is reconciled unto God, and an other that is not. One that is not reconciled unto God in Chriſt, is ſo under the Law, as every ſin he commits, be it little, or great doth put him under the ſentence, and curſe of eternal death:</hi> the neglect of any duty, be it never ſo ſmal doth it. But now, here is the priviledg of a Beleiver; when thou art once a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver, and ſo art in Jeſus Chriſt; then the ſins thou committeſt; thoſe ſhould indeed be for thy humiliation; but there is none of them that do put thee under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eternal death; neither upon this ground art thou to keep the Law: that is, to keep it ſo, as to think,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46564:73"/> that if thou do it not, or that every breach of the Law ſhould put thee under the ſentence of eternal death. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed others that are under the Law, they muſt looke to keep the Law, whether they be able or not; but the Law hath no power over thee that way, and thou art not upon that ground to keep it; and therefore thy ſins which thou committeſt, do not put thee under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentence of eternal death, as the ſins of others do: there is no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt; &amp; it is true of every moment, and inſtant of time, that there is no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt. I wil give you another ſcripture for this, that is as cleer as the other, though not perhaps ſo much taken notice of It is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For when we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the Law did worke in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> Note the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin which were by the Law did work in our members; What did they do? they brought forth fruite; and fruite unto death; this the bleſſed Apoſtle ſaith was when we were in the fleſh. But now being Beleevers; though we have the remainings, the motions of ſin, yet they are not ſuch as bring forth fruit unto death. None of the ſins of Beleivers bring forth fruite unto death, for they are delivered from that power of the Law; that the Law cannot come with the ſentence of death upon them. This is an high priviledg of Beleevers; and the right knowledg of this would help us that we ſhould not think, that our peace with God is ſo broken that God is our enemy through every ſin which through humane frailty is committed.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>You wil ſay; what need then Beleevers to be careful to avoid ſin; may they not take liberty to walke as they liſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O! No; there are other arguments beſides this. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had they a ſlaveiſh ſpirit, had they no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade them from ſin, but this, that ſin would make God, and them enemies, it were ſomewhat.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46564:74"/> Men that object, and ſay; that Beleivers may do what they liſt becauſe their peace with God cannot be broken: The truth is they themſelves have ſlaviſh hearts; and they do not know the ſtrength of other arguments to keep them from ſin. I deare boldly affirme this: that a Beleever ſhould not upon the Commiſſion of ſin think, that therefore he is now under the ſentence of death, if ſo be it be ſuch a ſin as may ſtand with the ſtate of Grace, as many weakneſſes, and frailties may; for there are ſome ſins; <hi>as liveing after the fleſh,</hi> which the ſcripture ſpeakes of, which if Beleivers live in they ſhal die. You wil ſay; what, can they periſh eternally? yet this is made as a means to keep them from living after the fleſh: But if they ſhould come to live after the fleſh which Gods grace wil keep them from doing in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way; they ſhal die; and ſo far they may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend eternal death were due unto them, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to fal into that condition, to live after the fleſh. But it is not true, that a Beleiver upon every ſin he committs ſhould be under the ſentence of death; for being once Beleevers we are freed from the Law. And therefore the Apoſtle after he had ſpoken of the Law of God to the ſame purpoſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. He anſwers this Objection. <hi>What ſhal we ſay then? ſhal we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid: How ſhal we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein:</hi> and then follows. <hi>Even as ſin hath raigned unto death; ſo grace muſt raigne through righteouſneſs to eternal life.</hi> The Grace of God raigns, domineers over al things that come to oppoſe it; even over al our infirmities, over al our ſins; over whatſoever may ſeem to contradict it; the grace of God raigns; there is a domineering power in the grace of God over al things that would contradict it; but this is through Righteouſneſs. Thou haſt ſin in thee that would oppoſe Gods reconciling Grace; but it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aigns notwithſtanding that ſin of thine, and it raigns to eternal life; it hath a raigning power to carry thee
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46564:74"/> through al difficulties, and hinderances to eternal life; and al through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Therefore Beleevers that they may keep their peace with God, are to look upon al duties required in the Law as bound to do them; and that they are not freed from the duties the Law requires; their relation unto God redeeming of them, doth not take away their relation unto God as a Creator; ſtil they are bound to God as a Creator; as wel as a Redemer: But they ſhould look upon the Law as comeing to them in the hand of Chriſt. It is an excellent ſpeech which <hi>Luther</hi> hath for this O! how ſweet (ſaith he) are the commandements of God unto us, when we receive them, not as they are in the Book; but as they are in the wounds of Chriſt? When we reade the Commandements of God in the wounds of Chrſt, And receive them there; O! how ſweet are they then? then we obey them out of ſweet principles, not out of Legal reſpects, as if upon every Breach we ſhould be brought under the ſentence of eternal death, as we did before. This I take to be the meaning of that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>For you have not received the ſpirit of Bondage againe to feare.</hi> What is the ſpirit of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? The ſpirit of Bondage that cauſeth feare at firſt; before one is a Beleever, is this; either perfectly obey the Law, or Periſh, ſaith the ſpirit, even the ſpirit of God, whether able, or no; you muſt obey every thing or die; and if thou haſt ſinned againſt the Law, thou art now accurſed notwithſtanding al the duties that thou haſt done; the ſpirit of God ſaith ſo to al unbeleivers and this cauſeth feare; but ſaith the Apoſtle; you have not received the ſpirit of Bondage to feare again; though perhaps thou mayeſt feare upon thy weakneſs, that God wil turne thine enemy upon every Breach: but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God ſaith not ſo, that thou art therefore accurſed but that ſpirit inableth thee to go to God as a Father to heale thy weakneſs, and to give thee power againſt them, and the Contrary is ſuch a miſtake as indeed is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46564:75"/> to the work of God, reconciliation of God in Chriſt. We muſt put much upon that great work which God puts ſo much upon, and if we did, we might go up, and down in the world, with a world of comfort, and it would increaſe ſanctification. Indeed to deny al kind of obleigment of the Law to God, and to ſay that men are not bound to keep it, as God being their Creator &amp;c there is an exſtream vanity in it, but to give the Law that which is its due, and to give the Beleever his due too; to ſhew how farr we are bound to it, and how far delivered from it, this is a great miſtery of the Goſpel and people ſhould labor to underſtand it aright, and take heed, leaſt out of a deſire to apprehend the grace of God in Chriſt, we do not go too farr in ovrthrowing our obligations to God by the Law. One would think, that this which <hi>I</hi> have delivered (if mens ſpirits were not very wanton) were enough, namely, that we are not under the ſentence of condemnation, though we are not freed from the Law, and the duties thereof as God is our Creator, and we ſhould think the grace of God magnified in this, and therefore thus far take hold, and make uſe of this Grace of God in Chriſt, as not to looſe the comfort of it. This is the firſt weakneſs that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men from preſerveing the comfortable aſſurance of their peace with God.</p>

When men that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ready to judg of Gods works through their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as works of enmity againſt them; not only of their waies towards God as an argument that God, and they are at enmity; but they are ready to judg al the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of Gods providence, as if they were the works of an enemy to them; as if God were in them, walking contrary to them: This is a great weakneſs, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor unto God. Let the wicked, and ungodly judg ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46564:75"/> if they Wil. As God ſaith; fury is not in me; who would ſet the briars, and the Thorns before him? he wil go through them. When God comes in outward waies of miſery; ungodly ones may look upon them as God walking in them contrary unto them; they may look upon al his works as the works of an enimy, and as one that intends their ruine, and deſtruction: they are to look upon every trouble, if it be but the leaſt diſtemper of their body as the beginnings of eternal wrath, and a making way for eternal miſery for ought they know. But they that are reconciled to God, it is their weakneſs if they ſhould look upon the greateſt affliction they meet withal as a work of Gods coming towards them as an enimy. No; you muſt know; that there is this power in your reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God in Chriſt; as</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there is nothing that ever God doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that doth tend to everlaſting wrath, nothing, whatever it be. Here is thy comfort; that thou mayeſt build upon this; though thy affliction be ſore, and though they be long upon thy body, or eſtate; perhaps thou looſeſt al that thou haſt, and it may be God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers thee up into the hand of thine enemies, and they trample upon thee as dirt; yet nothing of al this tends to eternal wrath. As on the contrary; though a wicked man may have a great many favors from God, and fruits of his patience; yet no wicked man hath ground to make ſuch an interpretation of any good thing he injoyes from God, as to think that this doth tend to his eternal good. So thoſe that are beleevers, though they meet with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great afflictions; yet they have not ſufficient ground to make this interpretation of thoſe afflictions; that they tend to their utter undoing. And one would think that this were enough on the other ſide; for men to beleeve; that whatſoever afflictions they meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in this world; the wrath of God in al thoſe afflictions is taken away; they ſhal not tend to their ruine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46564:76"/> miſery: that though the afflictions themſelves may remaine yet the poyſon of every affliction, which is the wrath of God, is taken away by Chriſt. Nay, whatſoever befals us in this world; is ſo far from ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to eternal miſery, that it is, through the love of God tending to thy good: that which doth ſeem to be moſt croſs to thy deſires, yet, it is ſuch as tends to thy everlaſting good in Chriſt. And this, one would think is enough for the ſattisfaction of mens hearts in the point of afflictions. As what was delivered before may be enough concerning our freedome from the Law; So what I have now writ in being chaſtened for our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Take but theſe two things that no evil, no chaſtiſement that ſhal befal us, ſhal tend to our everlaſting miſery nay, nothing ſhal befal us, but it is out of love and tends to our eternal good. Theſe two being granted, one would thing, one might grant any thing elſe; that God may ſhew a fatherly diſpleaſure againſt us for our ſins though not as a revenging judg; that God may exerciſe his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that way, to mannifeſt his holineſs, and how he diſliks ſin &amp;c. One would think this might ſafely be granted, granting the other two. And indeed theſe two and the other concerning the Law, al our divines that are <hi>Orthrodax</hi> grant, and theſe are enough to ſatisfie us about the free grace of God in Chriſt, and beleevers be throughly revited, and grounded in this, they may come to keep the aſſurance of their peace with God; for what ſhal hinder, either their ſins, or Gods afflictions; now neither of theſe ſhould hinder a beleevers peace, but that he may be able ſtil to preſerve it, looking upon God through Chriſt. This is concerning the looſing of the aſſurance of our peace through weakneſs.</p>

In the other, when it is but a dayly infirmity, and when it is ſuch as he ſtrivs againſt, he is eaſily ſatisfied; but when it comes to that, that it is very like walking after the fleſh; as indeed many fal ſo fouly, as you can ſcarcly perceive any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between one that works after the fleſh, and him; his exceedingly clouds the light of Gods favour, and exceedingly hinders the Comfort of his peace with God And O, how juſtly may the Lord abraid thee, and ſay what, did I ſet that infinit wiſdome of mine a work to find out ſuch a way of Reconciliation with thee? and is it worth no more then ſo, but that thou caſteſt of the comfort of it, that thou mighteſt give liberty to thy looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ, and negligence, and to have the fleſh have ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? And ſo Chriſt himſelf may abraid the: what, ſhal I come from the boſom of my father, and take upon me the form of a ſervant, and be made a curſe, that I might make peace between my father and thee, and is it worth no more but this; that thou caſteſt away the Comfort of thy aſſurance for ſuch a ſinful diſtemper of heart, to give thy liberty to live after the fleſh? Yea the Holy ſpirit may come, and a braid thee, and ſay. What, ſhal I come, and reveal the deep councells of God towards thee, and ſhew thee what thoſe things were that God
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46564:77"/> from all eternity hath done for thee? ſhal I open the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt unto thee, and draw thy heart unto him; and ſhal I ſpeak peace unto thee, and yet when al is done, thou ſhouldeſt regard this ſo little as for the ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſome baſe diſtemper of heart, looſe that which I have thus brought to thee; looſe the comfort of al that I have done for thee? both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, may abraid thy negligence, and the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy heart, and life. Yea, and thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may tell thee, and ſay, did not I often hint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that if thou didſt give liberty to thy ſelfe to walk thus, and thus looſely, thou ſhalt looſe thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and thou ſhouldſt' come to apprehend God to be a terror to thee? and wilt thou even in theſe dayes of tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when men crie out of feares, and dangers take ſuch a fooliſh courſe to looſe thy peace with God? Is there any thing in the baſe diſtemper of thy heart that can countervail this loſs?

                  <p>Againe, we have yet a further Uſe here If God be reconciled to us in Chriſt; it teacheth us to give God the glory of this great worke; adore the infinite wiſdome, and mercy, and goodnes of God in this work of his towards us, reconciling us to himſelfe in Jeſus Chriſt. When Chriſt was born, the Angels Sang; glory to God on high; peace on earth: and it was upon that ground that they Sang it: as if they ſhould have ſaid. O Lord, what a way is here for thee to make peace upon earth; that thou ſhouldeſt ſend thy Son? here we looke upon a poore Infant in a manger, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is the eternal God the ſecond perſon in Trinity, that hath thus taken mans nature upon him, and here he lyes in the cratch; even the ſame perſon that made the world. What a ſtrang work of God is this to bring peace upon Earth; peace after ſuch a way as this! glory be to God on high And this is the thing we ſhould ſpend our dayes in; to adore, the infinite wiſdom, and goodnes of God in this way of his, in reconciling the world to himſelfe in Chriſt. God expects, that al the children of men to whom Chriſt comes to be made known to, ſhould even fal upon their faces, and ſpend their days in adoring and prayſing, and magnifying this great work of God. God expects that we ſhould have mighty high thoughts of this work; and if our thoughts be not high
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46564:78"/> of this work, and be nor lift up above al Creatures, we do but take the name of God in vaine. God doth not care for any other glory we give him, except we give him the glory of this work. It is true when we ſee the works of God in the Earth, and in the Seas, we ſhould glorifie Gods power, and Gods wiſdom &amp;c. But except your heart be taken with this maſter peece (as I may ſo terme it) with this great work of God, of Reconciling himſelfe to the world in Chriſt; God wil rject al your other gloryfyings of him. I mean ſo reject them, as he wil not accept of them in compariſon: therefore this is the thing that God accepteth above al; and this is the comandement of God, that we ſhould beleeve in his ſon, and that we ſhould give the Father the glory due unto him for reconciling himſelfe to the world in his Son. This is the worke that ſhal be done in Heaven to al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: This is the thing that God himſelfe delights in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove al that ever he hath done; that takes up his heart above al. And if it do not take up your hearts, but you look upon it as an ordinary thing, and ſo indeed count the blood of Chriſt as a comon thing: O! know, it is a high indignity in that thing in which he doth expect moſt glory from. And let me ſay this; Hath God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this work of his Son unto thee; and is thy heart taken with this great work that God hath done; and art thou continualy adoring of the greatneſs of that work of God? peace be unto thee; for this is as Good an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that thou art reconciled unto God in Chriſt, as any I know.

                  <p>AGain. Is it in Chriſt that we are reconciled unto God? O! <hi>let Chriſt be beloved by us.</hi> Let us ſay with the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Lambert; None but Chriſt, None but Chriſt,</hi> which he ſpake too when he came to the ſtake to be burnt for Chriſt: a good Leſſen for us by the way to take out, that may come to ſuffer very hard things for that which we have undertaken to do in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God; yet for us to rejoyce when we come to ſuffer baniſhment, or loſs of goods, or life; to rejoyce that ever our hearts were ingaged in the waies of God; It is a ſign of grace indeed. Many men when things proſper can go on, and rejoyce that they were ingaged in ſuch a buſineſs, but if they find that it ſhal not proſper by outward ſucceſs, and that there are many miſcarriages, they repent of what they have done; and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we have ſo many run away now, and have withdrawn themſelves from that which before they would ſpend their lives, and deareſt blood in, and not only withdraw themſelves when they ſee the work a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hot, but betray the cauſe: But here is a tryal of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; that if I have engaged my ſelf in the waies of God; and God by his providence caſts me into ſuch waies as bring trouble unto me, yet I can rejoyce that ever I was ingaged in them. Thus it was with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Martyr that cried out none but Chriſt, even then when he was at the ſtake for Chriſt. It may be a Carnal heart might ſay. Yea, <hi>Lambert</hi> before you rejoyced in Chriſt, and talked of Chriſt, but what ſay you now? that you are come to be burnt for Chriſt; had you kept Chriſt within your ſelf, you might have preſerved this Body of yours: O! no, Chriſt was even then, ſweet unto this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46564:79"/> man, when he was going to ſuffer for him, and even then, none but Chriſt. And indeed there is cauſe ſufficient for Chriſt to be dear, and ſweet unto us even in the midſt of al ſufferings. It is true, it may cauſe us to have the world to be our enemy; but what of that, when Chriſt hath made peace between us, and God the father; this ſatisfies the ſoul of a man to the ful, and therefore the ſoul wil love him, and will rejoyce in him, and bleſs God that ever he was ingaged in any cauſe for the ſake of Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt is his bleſſed Reconciler, and becauſe Chriſt hath made a peace between God, and his heart; although men are his enemies, yet he knows that through Chriſt God is his friend. Chriſt hath made men our enemies indeed but it is accidentally, but he hath made God our friend; and he himſelf ſaith; <hi>Do you think</hi> I <hi>come to bring Peace? No, I come to bring a ſword:</hi> through the profeſſion of the Goſpel there is a great deal of enmity amongſt men and I beleeve this rage, and enmity that is on root here in England, Chriſt himſelf accidentally is the cauſe of it. On the one ſide, the deſire of Gods people is for a through Reformation; and on the other ſide the hatred of mens ſpirits againſt Chriſt, and his Ordinances, wil rather undo themſeleves then Chriſt ſhal have any Glory, they wil rather put their Necks under an Antichriſtian yoak, yea, under the yoak of ſlavery, and make themſelves, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſlaves, then to be under the yoak of Chriſt; and this is the very bottom of that bitter mallice and rage that is now in the hearts of men, for there was never the like example of a people, that ſhould be enraged one againſt another for their own mind. We might have peace, and we might have liberry if we would but unite our ſelves as one man againſt Papiſts, and others that are notorious, and abominably wicked to ſubdue them. But now becauſe that peace, and liberty would bring in Reformation with it, and men ſhould not have that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for their luſts as heretofore they have had, upon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46564:79"/> that they will have no peace at all; and they will rather be ſlaves to the wills and luſts of men, and to the Devil, then come under Chriſts yoak. Thus the Goſpel is in great part, the cauſe of the ſword by accident. What though? Shal we not love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Shall we ſay? ſince there was ſo much preaching, and profeſſion, we have had ſuch and ſuch wars, and ſtrifes, and troubles: would men be quiet, and contented, they might be at peace. O! what is this, but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be without Chriſt, without truth, without peace of Conſcience? ſo that becauſe we would fain have theſe; that is, we would fain have Chriſt, and fain have the Goſpel, and truth, and peace of Conſcience, we can have no peace with men, but yet bleſſed be God for Chriſt; for although Chriſt be as a bundle of mirth, that hath much bitterneſs in it, yet let him lie between your breaſts, let us rejoyce in him, let us love him, let us bleſs God for him, and be glad that ever we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his Cauſe. O! that great Peace-maker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, how dear ſhould he be to our hearts? And as that <hi>Martyr</hi> ſaid when he was to ſuffer for him. <hi>What have I but one life to lay down for Chriſt? O! that I had many;</hi> So ſhould we ſay; what, is our life in danger for Chriſt? O! that we had many lives that might be al in danger for him. I heard a credible relation of a yong man that was in the buſineſs that was in <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp; had a ſhot through the ſhoulder, and fel down as dead, and for a while lay as dead, but recovering and getting up, and having ſtrengh enough to diſcharg a musket; ſaid, wel, I wil ſpend one life more for this Cauſe. The truth is, had we one, yea an hundred, a thouſand lives, we might very wel beſtow them in a cauſe wherein we might teſtifie our love to Chriſt, and bleſs God that ever we were engaged therin though it hath brought ſuch a diſturbance between man, and man. And let this be one particular wherein you are to manifeſt your love to Jeſus Chriſt as the great Reconciler; namly, that you
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46564:80"/> are willing to be reconciled one to another, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to your Brethren for his ſake: this is one good way to manifeſt your love to Chriſt. It may be ſuch, and ſuch have wronged you, and there is a great breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch a neighbor and you. A natural man may be willing to be reconciled upon natural grounds; it is a troubleſome thing to be in Contention, and it is more comfortable to be at peace with my Neighbor; and ſo through a natural love unto peace ſome wil be contented there ſhould be peace made between them, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they are fallen out withal; and it is good to go ſo far: But when you can bring your ſelves to this; not onely out of love to peace, becauſe it is good for neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to be reconciled; but when you can think thus. Chriſt hath reconciled my ſoul when I was an enemy unto God; he hath come down from the boſom of his Father, and laid down his life for me: and Chriſt is diſhonored when there are ſuch breaches between friend, and friend; therefore out of love to Jeſus Chriſt who hath reconciled my ſoul unto the Father I am willing out of that very principle to be at peace with others.</p>

               <p>ANd thus we have gone through that point of Gods being reconciled to us in Chriſt. There is another; Namely. The Sixt thing propounded in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viz. That God <hi>[was]</hi> reconcileing the world to himſelf in his ſon. <hi>The work of our Reconciliation, is not a work of yeſterday; it is a work that God was doing from all eternity;</hi> for the point is from that particle he <hi>[was]</hi> this work; for God to reconcile us to himſelf in his ſon, hath taken up the heart of God from al eternity. That place in <hi>Titus,</hi> 1.2. Is moſt remarkable for this <hi>In hope of eternal Life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began:</hi> he not onely promiſed it now; but he promiſed it before the world began. who was there before the world began to whom God made this promiſe? There was his Son Jeſus Chriſt. So then, that is the meaning when he ſaith God [was] reconcileing himſelf to the world; that there was from al eternity, a tranſaction as it were between God the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46564:81"/> Father, and God the ſon about our Reconciliation: there was not only a purpoſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>elf; but there was a real, and actual tranſaction between the Father and Son about it; an agreement between God the Father, and God the Son about it. Gods Wiſdom from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was exerciſed to find out a way. Secondly, Gods purpoſe was from al eternity to do it. And Thirdly, There was a tranſaction between God the Father, and God the Son from al Eternity for to do it: they did covenant one with the other: God the Father told his Son what he required of him; and God the Son promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Father to do it; there was ſuch a tranſaction as this; and therefore the ſcripture ſaith, it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the world began; God the Father did promiſe to his Son before the world began what he would do for thoſe that he would dy for; as if he ſhould have ſaid. Thou art content to lay down thy life, and to ſhed thy blood? Yea, ſaith the Son, I am: wel, ſaith the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I wil be reconciled unto them, and I wil ſave their ſouls; they ſhal have eternal life for their portion; this I promiſe thee; and ſo, it was promiſed to Chriſt firſt. It is true the promiſes of the Goſpel are ſweet, and they ſhould rejoyce our hearts; I had periſhed in my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſaith <hi>David,</hi> had I not had ragard unto thy word: nothing more ſweet to a ſoul then the promiſes are; but though the promiſes that are made to us in the Goſpel are ſweet; yet the promiſe that was made to the Son of God, is infinitly more ſweet. And this is the thing that I ſhould have ſhewed you: not only how this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto Chriſt; but the excellent comfort that this is unto the Saints; that they are now to look upon al that is done unto them, and upon all the works of Gods grace to them, not as a new thing; not as an accidental thing that comes. As if we ſhould have peace here in the Commonwealth it would be pretiouſe to us, if it ſhould be upon theſe tearms, and we would al rejoyce
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46564:81"/> much in what ſhould befall us in a way of a ſafe peace: But our peace with God is not wrought with God ſo, as if we were periſhing, and then Gods providence came and turned all about againe. No, our peace with God is a thing plotted from al eternity; God did as it were contrive it in Heaven before any world was made: God thought of this work of Reconcileing himſelfe unto the world; yea, unto thee in particular if thou beeſt a Beleever, a broken hearted ſinner, before even the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or the Earth were made, God had actual thoughts of thee ſtil; and there was a Covenant between God the Father and the Son, for thy ſoul in particular; and though God foreſaw thou wouldeſt ſin againſt him, and turne enemy to him, yet there was a conſultation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, and the Son from al eternity to bring thy ſoul home unto God, and to pardon thy ſin. So that thou art to look upon al the works of Gods grace towards thee here in bringing thee to his Son, and upon all the comforts thou haſt from his Son, as the fruit of Gods eternal plot, of Gods eternal councel with his Son: and that although it doth but now break forth, yet it was that which was in the boſom of the Father, and the Son from al eternity; and this indeed wil ſweeten our Reconciliation with God, and al means tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As, doth God ſend but the word of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring you home unto Chriſt? this was that which there was a Contrivance of in the heart of God from al eternity. That in ſuch a time, ſuch a man ſhould live, in ſuch a place, and ſuch a Miniſter ſhould be ſent amongſt them, and ſuch a text of ſcripture ſhould be opened, and ſuch truths ſhould be preached, and if thou findeſt God bringing of theſe truths home to thy ſoul: know, it is a fruit of that eternal counſel that was between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son before the world began; and a branch of the promiſe that God made to his Son from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Do'ſt thou, when thou comeſt to the word begin to feel thy mind inlightned, to know Jeſus Chriſt? doth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46564:82"/> thy heart begin to be melted, is thy ſoul drawing after Chriſt? do not look upon this as a meer accidental thing; do not ſay only, What a providence of God is it that called me to ſuch a Sermon? at ſuch time I went for company ſake to ſuch a place; but when I came, I felt the Spirit of God ſtirring in my Soul; yea, I find a beginning of that which I hope I ſhal have cauſe to bleſs God for, for ever. Do not look upon this as a meer accidental thing, or as an act of providence only; But know, that this very work of God towards thee, is no other then the fruit of the promiſe that God made to his Son before the world began. God promiſed his Son, that it ſhould be ſo ordered, that at ſuch a time there ſhould be ſuch a Text, and ſuch a Sermon preached, and that it ſhould ſo fall out that thou ſhould'ſt be there And ſo likewiſe any peace of Conſcience; any work of grace whatſoever, is a fruit of this promiſe; and therefore rejoyce in this; that Gods heart is broken open unto thee; and that which was in his boſom from al eternity is made known unto thee.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men that are not converted til they be old, have cauſe to be ſorrowful, and to be troubled for that: It is true I have cauſe to bleſs God, that at length God is pleaſed to open his heart unto me; But what a miſery is it to me that I lived ſo long before I came to know God the Fathers purpoſe to my heart, had I embraced the Goſpel firſt, I had then been made acquainted with the councel of God from al eternity concerning me. And a mighty encouragement it is to yong people to bleſs God for this, that God begins with them betimes; it is a ſign that Gods heart is ful when he begins with one ſo early. For the truth is, Gods heart was towards thee from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and the buſineſs was tranſacting from everlaſting. Some, though the heart of God be towards them, yet he keeps it a long time from breaking open til they grow to their middle age, til old age it may be, and then he diſcloſeth himſelf. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not open his heart
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46564:82"/> to his Brethren for many daies together. So there are many people, that God lets them go on a long while in waies of ſin, he withdraws himſelf, and denies himſelf to open his heart to them, but at lengh he doth: But then how much better is it when God ſhal open his heart betimes unto a man? Would not <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren have been glad that he ſhould have diſcovered himſelf unto them and opened his heart unto them at the firſt coming? So, you that do begin now to have the day of grace dawn into your underſtandings, and God begins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to open himſelf, and thoſe things that were in his heart before the beginning of the world diſcovers them to thee; and God cannot (as we may ſpeak with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) ſtay any longer; but as ſoon as thou art able to receive in thoſe thoughts of the heart of God; he lets them out unto thee. O! bleſs God for it. And this will prevent abundance of ſin and ſorrow, and make thee go on with comfort al thy daies. This point alſo ſhould be a marvelous Comfort to the people of God. That their peace with God doth not ſo much depend upon the Covenant God hath made with them; but it depends upon the Covenant God hath made with Jeſus Chriſt from al eternity; and that is the roote and bottom of their peace, and Reconciliation with God. Alas were it a dependance upon a Covenant between us, and God, and what he requires of us; we could not have firm peace: But when we know this; that the root, and ground, of our peace, and happineſs, dependeth upon that tranſaction that there was between the Father, and the Son from al eternity, and upon the Covenant that was between them: O! this is that which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce the hearts of the Saints, and be a mighty foundation of their Faith, and inable them to go through the world, and al difficulties with Comfort.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 31</hi> The work of our Reconciliation with God in Chriſt hath been a doing from al eternity.</head>
               <p>IN the laſt Chapter we came to the ſixt point that formerly hath been propounded in the firſt Chapter; and that is this. That God [Was] reconcileing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the world in Chriſt. [Was] and when was he? Even from all eternity, he was reconcileing himſelfe to the world. That point I did then name, and ſhal now a little inlarge it, and ſo proceed to ſome other. The point is this.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That the worke of our Reconciliation with God in Chriſt, it is not a work of yeſterday, it is a work that hath been doing from al eternity;</hi> it is not a thing that fals out as it were accidentally, but a plotted thing, a thing that hath been plotted from al eternity. I gave you then but only one ſcripture for it: I ſhal ad ſome more now, and open it more fully. That ſcripture I gave in the 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>In hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began.</hi> Now to whom did God promiſe it before the world began? The firſt promiſe that was made, and that we read of, was to <hi>Adam</hi> in paradice, the ſeed of the woman ſhal break the Serpents head. O! but there was a promiſe beyond that promiſe; a promiſe made before <hi>Adam</hi> was, or before the Angells were, or before the world began; a promiſe of eternal life, which is the accompliſhment of our reconciliation with God; this promiſe could be made to no other, but to the Son of God that was with the Father, and the delight of the Father; not only the delight of the Father as he is the Son eternally begotten of the Father, but the delight of the Father
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46564:83"/> as he undertooke the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> work of Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and us; and this promiſe was made to him from the Father; the promiſe of Reconciliation, and eternal life before the world began. So that by that ſcripture it appeares; that there was from al eternity, not onely a purpoſe, or a determination in God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to himſelf; but there was an agreement, a tranſaction between the Father, and the Son about it, and a Covenant paſſed between them. God the Father promiſeth ſomwhat, and the Son promiſeth ſomwhat, and ſo they make up the agreement one with another from al eternity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There was a tranſaction of this great work of Reconciliation between God the Father, and the Son from all eternity; and for this I ſhal give you a ſcripture or two more. 2 <hi>Timo.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works; But according to his own purpoſe, and grace which was given us in Jeſus Chriſt before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> Here is not onely a purpoſe, but here is grace beſides purpoſe; there was not onely a purpoſe in God before the world began, but there was ſomwhat more; here is purpoſe and grace, and this is given to us too; it is not only intended for us (that is obſerveable) but it was given us, and given us before the world began: how given us? could God give any thing to us before the world began; could God give any thing to us before we were? It is therefore added; it was <hi>his purpoſe, and grace,</hi> and <hi>given to us [in Chriſt]</hi> before the world began. As it is poſſible for an Inheritance to be made over to one before he was borne; ſomtimes between man and man, there is ſomething made over thus, to our heires lawfully begotten, though there be none born, yet it is given them; and there is ſolemnity in Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Perhaps it is given to ſome as a feofee; that if ſuch, and ſuch ſhould be borne, they ſhould injoy it; or that they ſhal imploy this for the benefit of ſuch, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46564:84"/> ſuch that ſhal be born; ſo Jeſus Chriſt ſtood before the Father (as we may ſo terme it) as a feofee in truſt, as the head of a Covenant, and there were tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, and him; there was not onely a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in God to reconcile himſelfe to us, but there was grace given to us in Chriſt; there was an actual donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this unto Chriſt before the world began, that ſo we might come to Injoy it.</p>
               <p>Again, another Scripture for this is the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. which ſpeakes ſomwhat of this alſo, though not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo fully as the former. The words are theſe. <hi>But we Speake the wiſdom of God in a miſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordeyned before the world to our glory.</hi> He doth not only ſpeake here of Gods Electing, of Gods ordaining us to Glory; but he ſpeakes of the whole miſtery of the Goſpel, which he calles the hiden wiſdom of God. Now this doctrin of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I have been preaching to you, about that we are reconciled to God in Chriſt, this is the hiden wiſdom of God which was kept hid from the begining of the world, and yet ordayned before the world to our glory. God had contrived al this doctrin of Reconciliation, and purpoſed, that in time it ſhould come to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, as it is at this day.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Scripture for this which is very remarkable. It is in the 17. <hi>John.</hi> you ſhal finde in that chapter many expreſſions to that purpoſe; that thoſe that did beleeve in Chriſt were ſuch as God the Father had given him: and you may find by divers expreſſions there apparantly, that there was an agreement, a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction between the Father, and the ſon, long before the thing was done; verſe 16. <hi>I have manifeſted my name to the men thou gaveſt me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word;</hi> he doth not ſpeak meerly of giving them at this time; but of Giving them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e ſon before now, for he makes that to be the ground of their beleife; he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46564:84"/> doth not make their givi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>em to him to be beleeving; but he makes their beleeving, and the keeping of the word of faith, to be a fruit of Gods giving them to his Son, the fathers giving them to his Son is the foundation of their beleeving, and hence it is that in time they come to beleive; becauſe God the father hath from al eternity given them to his Son: that is the argument of Chriſt &amp; this indeed makes the difference between ſome that beleeve, &amp; others that do not beleeve. There are ſom that are of mean parts, poor people, and yong ones that beleive in Jeſus Chriſt, and the great miſteries of the Goſpel; others that have more underſtanding, that are learned men, they do not beleive. That which makes the difference is this: that God the father gives ſome to his ſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile, and he doth not give others: and this is the argument of Chriſt in that 17, <hi>John.</hi> he makes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their faith to be God the fathers giving of them to the Son. So that it is apparent in Scripture, that there hath been (before we come to beleeve, ye a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was) a tranſaction between the father, and the Son about our reconciliation. <hi>God was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling himſelf to the world,</hi> So that our Reconciliation with God, and the having our ſinns not imputed muſt be conſidered in three periods of time. The firſt is (if we may cal that a period of time, which rather was before time) that which was from al eternity with the Son; there God was reconciling himſelf unto us. Secondly; when Chriſt came into the world, and was upon the Croſs, and ſuffered; there was an actual imputation of the ſins of al the Elect unto him, and a laying of them upon Chriſt; there was then a ſpecial act of God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and charging upon his Son, the Sins of al the elect. Thirdly when God cals any ſinner to beleeve; then there is an other act of God paſſing the Sentence of abſolution upon the Soul, an actual paſſing of it, which we cal Juſtification: As it is between man, and man; you know the law may be ſatsfied for the priſoner, and yet the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46564:85"/> Priſoner not abſolved; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſoner is not acquitted, til the ſentence be ſo ſolemnly pronounced by the Judg, though the verdict be brought in, not guilty, yet he is not acquitted until the Judg pronunce the ſentence of abſolution. So, though Jeſus Chriſt in his ſufferings when he was crucified, ſatisfied the law for al that ſhould beleive in him; yet there is required a pronouncing of the Sentence by the Judg for the acquitting of, which is our Juſtification. And yet ſomtimes we know, that after the ſentence is pronounced by the Judg, the malefactor may ly in Priſon til the fees be pay'd. Juſt thus it is with us: after our juſtification, yet we remain in this world, and have the fetters of our corruption upon us, have the fetters of afflictions, and troubles upon us til we have pay'd the dues to nature, and the diſpenſations of Gods Providence. One that is Elect, and not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, he is as a priſoner that hath the Law ſatisfied for him, though he doth not know it; yet certainly he ſhal be ſaved: One that is Elect, and a beleever is as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner that hath the Judg pronouncing the ſentence of abſolution upon him; yet afterwards, ſo long as the Beleever is in this world, he is like a Priſoner that hath had his ſentance pronounced upon him to acquit him, but he lies in Priſon til he hath pay'd his fees. But thoſe in Heaven; they have not only the Law ſatisfied, and the fees pay'd, but they are ſet at liberty alſo, and are in their Fathers houſe. There are Several times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Gods manifeſtation of our Reconciliation to us not imputing our Sinns unto us.</p>
               <p>But though there be ſuch ſeveral workings of God, yet this doth not argue any change in God, which is an <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> that many through weakneſs make; that becauſe God doth this thing, and the other thing &amp; the other thing that was not done before, therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> would argue, as if there were a charge in God, and therefore would conclude; that there is nothing that is now done, but was done, and that as it is now done, ſo it was done everlaſtingly.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46564:85"/> But we are to know this; that Gods actual pronouncing of a ſentence of abſolution now; was not done before, doth no more argue a change in God; than Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Saints in Heaven now, who were not glorified before. To be Juſtified in time, doth no more argue a change in God, than to be glorified in time argueth it. The Saints upon Earth are not yet glorified, and yet they ſhal be glorified, and that argues no change in God. So the Elect that are not yet Beleevers, are not yet Juſtified in that ſenſe the Scripture ſpeaks of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yea they ſhal be Juſtified: and that argues no change in God.</p>
               <p>But that we may further underſtand this, how God was from all Eternity reconciling himſelf unto the world, yet there are ſeveral periods of time wherein there are ſeveral workings of God towards a ſinner, which indeed are implyed in the words of the Text. God was reonciling the world to himſelf; he <hi>[Was]</hi> a doing of it; and this work before it comes to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, hath ſeveral periods of of time. And to the end you may underſtand it the better; You muſt know, that there is a great deal of difference between thoſe actings of God which are in himſelf, according to his own nature, and thoſe actions of his towards the creature that are in a ſuitable way to the Creature; and for the want of the right underſtanding of the diffrence between theſe two, many people do moſt groſsly miſtake and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many abſurd Concluſions. They agrue from Gods infinite, and unconceiveable way of acting in himſelf, to thoſe acts of God that are ſuitable to the Creature, and received by the Creature; when they heare of any thing of the workings of God received by the creature, they would underſtand that in the ſame manner, or as if it were to be underſtood in the ſame manner as thoſe acts of God in himſelfe. I wil ſhew you how great a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is between them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take the Acts of God in himſelf, and this is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46564:86"/> true, the act of God is the Beeing of God himſelf, Gods Eſſence, and his act in himſelf, are allone: but now the act of God as the Creature receives it, is not the Eſſence of God, for the Creature is not capable of Gods eſſence, for then the Creature ſhould be infinite. But the act of God as it is in himſelfe, is God himſelf, and ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; there is no act as it is in God, but it is an infinite act becauſe is is God. As now that which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture receives cannot be infinite. So the acts of God in himſelfe, are al eternal, and there is no difference of time with God; there is not time paſt, preſent, and to come. Look upon the acts of God as he worketh in himſelf: whatſoever act there is in God, even the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Saints; ſo far as Conſidered in God, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; And there is no difference of time at al in the acts of God, as in himſelf; But if one conſider thoſe acts as the Creature receives them; then we muſt looke at the difference of time, one, at one time, another at another, and another at another, received by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And you muſt take heed of too much boldneſs when we ſpeak of God; when God ſometimes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth his workings as the Creature receives; we muſt not then thinke, that theſe are the acts of God as they are in himſelf, which are infinite, and to be conceived in an infinite manner, ſo as nothing but an infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is able to reach, and to conceive of. Therefore thoſe men that think to fatham the arts of God as they are in himſelfe, they are too too preſumptuous; for only an infinite underſtanding is able to conceive of them; we muſt conceive of them as the Creature receives them, and ſo as they are revealed in the word; and this is the ſubſtance of what is revealed concerning Gods working towards us; namly; that from eternity, there was a transfaction between him, and the Son in ſuch an unconceivable maner as we know not of; and that in time the Lord did lay our ſins upon his Son on the Croſs, and that afterwards when his good time ſhall come to call a ſinner to himſelf, then he doth juſtifie him, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46564:86"/> prononce a ſentence of abſolution. But firſt, he calls them; So the ſcripture ſaith thoſe whom he hath called, he hath juſtified. The Scripture makes calling of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to go before juſtification; therefore whatſoever is in God from eternity; yet it is apparent that (ſpeaking of juſtification as the ſcripture ſpeakes of it) Vocation goes before, and that juſtification is no otherwiſe from eternity, than Vocation. God may as truly be ſaid to cal a ſinner out of his natural eſtate from eternity, as to juſtifie a ſinner from eternity in that ſence that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes of it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. But, when we ſpeak of juſtification ordinarily, we ſpeak of it in the ſence that the ſcripture ſpeakes of it here, and ſo Vocation is firſt, and then juſtification, and afterwards glorification. So that though the Lord be pleaſed to reveale much of the miſtery of the Goſpel to us, and tel us he hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileing himſelf to us from eternity, yet we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this in a ſober way, and take heed we do not vaniſh in our own thoughts when we come to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>

For the covenant is two fold; either between God, and Chriſt, or between Chriſt and us. Now, it is true, much doth depend upon our keeping Covenant with Chriſt; but our happineſs; and Salvation, and indeed al our good doth cheifely depend upon the Covenant between the Father, and the Son.</p>

                  <p>Againe, Here we may ſee how to anſwer that queſtion of ſome Atheiſts; what God was doing before the world began? I remember it is ſaid, that when that queſtion was asked by ſome in the primitive times; the anſwer was. That God was makeing of Hel for ſuch curiouſe Inquiſitiors. But here we have a further, anſwer to give then that; namely; That God was exerciſed from al eternity in the buſineſs of Reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. God had (as it were) the idea, and the platform of all things before him; and ſaw man how he was made in his Innocency, and ſaw him fal, and ſaw how he ſhould riſe againe, and how he ſhould be converted, and glorified. Al the platform of al theſe things was before God from al eternity. As a work man when he goes to build an Houſe, or to build a ſhip, he hath the platform thereof in his head, before he ſtrikes a ſtrook. So the great work of our Election, of our Vocation, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Reconciliation, adoption, ſanctification, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, the Lord had the platforme of al before him; it was all in his Head as it were, and he was exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it before the world began: ſo that if thou art a Beleiver, it now comes to be knowen; that the Lord
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46564:87"/> from al eternity was exerciſed about thee, and thy good and about the Contrivance of thy Salvation, and fore ſaw how thou wouldeſt fal from him, and be made a child of wrath, and an Heir of Hel.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46564:88"/> ſweet unto thee? poor ſoul, look on this ſide, and look on the other ſide, and ſee thoſe Oceans of Eternal Love, on both ſides towards thee. Alas, this is a little that thou haſt now; but if thou lookeſt on one ſide; there thou ſhalt ſee that eternal love of God that was toward thee before the world was made. And if thou lookeſt on the other ſide, thou ſhalt ſee eternal life in al that glory which ſhal never have an end, which thou ſhalt actually be poſſeſſed of; and that which thou art for the preſent in the poſſeſſion of, is a little ſtream in compariſon of theſe two great Oceans of love that are from eternity, to eternity. And when thou heareſt that God intends to make thee happy for ever, and that thou ſhalt continue a glorious, and bleſſed creature as long as God himſelf ſhal live; and that thou ſhalt be happy as long as God ſhal be happy. Perhaps thou thinkeſt, how is this poſſible, is it poſſible for ſuch a poor fraile creature as I am to live to be happy as long as God himſelf ſhal be happy? Yes, do not doubt of it, though it be a great thing, for God hath had a love to thee from al eternity; therefore, though it is true there be many frailties, and many ſins of thine, yet that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder thee of that eternal mercy that God hath been plotting for thee.

                  <hi>CHAP. 33.</hi> Of Gods Reconciling the world to himſelfe.</head>
               <p>THE next point being the ſeventh propounded in the firſt chapter is: <hi>That God was Reconcileng the [World]</hi> to himſelfe. So the text Saith; and ſo the Point is. That God hath been reconciling the <hi>[World]</hi> to himſelfe. This which we have in the text heer it is the very ſame in effect with that we have in <hi>John.</hi> 3.16. So God loved the <hi>[World]</hi> that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeved in him ſhould not periſh but have Everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The world</hi> you wil ſay; how is that? did God recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile al the world, to himſelfe?</p>
               <p>No, we are therefore to underſtand this ſaying here <hi>as an indifinite Propoſition, and not as if it were an univerſal Propoſition;</hi> and the right underſtanding of this difference between an univerſal, and an indefinite propoſition is of great use to us, both in this, and many other points of divinity. An Univerſal Propoſition, is that, that ſpeaketh ſo of the general, as it includes every particuler under it, An indefinite Propoſition, doth but ſpeake of the general, and not include every particuler under it, but only many. As thus. If one ſhould ſay, that ſuch a man teacheth al the Children in ſuch a Towne; we do not mean that there is no perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Child that is not thaught, for there are infants there;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46564:89"/> and there are perhaps ſome that are not taught at al; but we mean thus; that he teacheth, thoſe Children that are taught; there is none that he excepteth but if they come to him, he wil teach them, he is there ready, and ſtands prepared to teach them; and in this ſenſs he may be ſaid to teach al the Children in the Town; that is; there is a genneral propoſition without a particuler reſtriction, though every individual is not contayned in it. This now is an Indefinit propoſition, or ſpeech. But when we Say a general propoſition, then we ſpeek of al par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers none at al can be excepted, But muſt come under that propoſition: and this wil help us much in other Points of divinity. As in the promiſe: <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy Seed.</hi> We muſt underſtand this Promiſe by the way of an indefinite propoſition, and ſo al underſtand it that underſtand it aright. Many that underſtand not the difference between theſe two, think they have a ſtrong objection, and ſay; This promiſe cannot be made of the godly, for then the Children of the Godly would be godly too. No, it is not an Univerſal propoſition that includeth every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but an indefinite one; that is thus. God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to be the God of his people, and of their ſeed; that is, he wil ſhew mercy to their Seed, rather then to the Seed of others, and he wil rather draw the line of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction through their Loyns then through the Loyns of others, he wil take them, not every particular of them, but take them indefinitly, and not reveal which of them he wil take; whether this Perſon, or that Perſon indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually; But he ſpeaks indifinitly; and his meaning is, that thoſe that are the Seed of his people ſhall be brought into a neerer Pale; into a neerer limit of Gods Grace, then the Seed of others, and he wil be gratious to their Seed, rather then to others. And ſo here, <hi>God ſaved the World,</hi> and <hi>reconciled the World,</hi> the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are to be underſtood alike, indefinitely; not that he loveth, or reconcileth every individual Perſon in the world Even as he is the God of the Seed of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46564:90"/> Saints. It is not to be underſtood that he is the God of every particular one of them; he is pleaſed to expreſs himſelf thus indefinitly, and not generally.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 34.</hi> Gods reconciling [the World] to himſelf, cannot be meant of every individual man; proved by Scripture: And Three Reaſons.</head>
               <p>BUt for the opening of this. That God is reconciling himſelf unto the world; that is, unto man-kind, to humane nature, though not to every individuall perſon that is in humane nature. I ſhal ſhew you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it cannot be meant of every individual. And then.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why it is expreſſed in ſuch a large tearm as the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhal make it appear, That it cannot be meant of every particular man, or woman in the world: Nay, indeed, the truth is, that there is a great part in the world and ſuch a part as the world may receive deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from too, that Chriſt hath rejected, &amp; ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reconciled to: and that is cleer in <hi>John.</hi> 17. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That he prayed not for the World,</hi> ſurely then he died not for the world: there are ſome in the world that Chriſt did not ſo much as pray for; How was God reconciling himſelf to the world then, when as Chriſt profeſſeth, he did not pray for the world? It appears by this, that we are not to underſtand it of every particular man, or woman in the world; there are ſome that are in the world that God was never reconciling himſelf unto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And beſides this Text, it appears from hence.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46564:90"/> Becauſe if God were reconciling himſelf to al the world, then al ſhould certainly beleeve, and be ſaved; Why? Becauſe that Chriſt ſhould lay down a price for al, and the blood of Chriſt doth as wel pardon the ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as any other ſin. If there be any one that Chriſt hath laid down his life for, he hath purchaſed at the hands of God the Father, that this Soul ſhould be delivered from the power of unbelief; and Faith it is a bleſſing that comes unto us by Chriſt, as wel as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleſſing. I appeal to you; Is not Faith a ſpiritual bleſſing, as wel as any other Grace? <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt.</hi> So that al ſpiritual bleſſings are in Chriſt; if they are in Chriſt, then Faith is in Chriſt, for Faith is a ſpiritual bleſſing, and then Chriſt hath purchaſed Faith, for whoſoever Chriſt hath died for, they muſt beleeve in time; Chriſt hath not left the work of our ſalvation looſe upon this adventure. I wil lay down my life, and in caſe men beleeve, they ſhal be reconciled; No, Chriſt laid down his Life to purchaſe of God the Father, that men ſhould beleeve, as wel as he hath purchaſed eternal life it ſelf; and therefore if thou beleeveſt, know, it is the fruit of the purchaſe of Chriſt, as wel as Heaven it ſelf is. So then, if God were reconciled to all the world, al ſhould come, and be actually Beleevers; But in that they do not, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that Chriſt never intended it. That is one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then. Another argument may be this. If this were ſo, that Chriſt had laid down a price for the world in general, and only thoſe that are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to beleeve, or not beleeve, ſhould come to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Then the great things that are conteined in theſe great Myſteries of godlineſs, and the great works of God, both in Election, Redemption, Juſtification, &amp; Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt rather depend upon mans wil, than upon any
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46564:91"/> work of God; for ſay they; God indeed hath wrought al this; but it is in caſe men beleeve, he hath left it to them to beleeve, or not beleeve, and ſo al the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of God muſt depend upon mans wil: No certainly, Chriſt hath not left it ſo, but thoſe that he hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God, he hath ſo reconciled them to him, as that they ſhal beleeve, and this is not al the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Further: If this were ſo, that Chriſt hath payed a price, and left it to mans free will to beleeve, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; the truth is, <hi>Judas</hi> would have been as much beholding to Chriſt for Salvation, as <hi>Peter.</hi> But you wil ſay, <hi>Judas</hi> was never ſaved, <hi>Peter</hi> was; But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe men, Chriſt did as much for <hi>Judas</hi> as for <hi>Peter,</hi> for he ſhed his blood for <hi>Judas</hi> as wel as for <hi>Peter;</hi> only <hi>Peter</hi> by the act of his free wil, beleeved, and the other did not. So that the truth is, according to the doctrine of theſe men, <hi>Peter</hi> ſhal be no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Chriſt at the day of judgment, than <hi>Judas</hi> was. Peter indeed muſt acknowledg that he was ſaved by Chriſt; but if their doctrine be true, he may wel ſay; Lord; thou haſt done no more for me, than for <hi>Judas,</hi> and what was more, I did that my ſelfe, thou ſhedeſt thy blood a like for us, but I beleeved, and he did not, if he had beleeved he might have been ſaved as wel as I; ſo hereby the grace of God is exceedingly dishonored by theſe men that hold univerſal Redemption by Chriſt, and make it to include al the world. There are many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that might be uſed, which becauſe they are not ſo cleer to the ordinary capacities of people, we ſhal leave further mentioning of them at this time; and ſhal only ad; that it is Arminian doctrine, to teach, that there is a price payed by Chriſt for al the world, and it is left unto men to beleeve, or not to beleeve: And that is true evangelical doctrine; That there is a price payed by Chriſt, and God hath reſolved upon ſuch, and ſuch particular ones in the world that he wil be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that they ſhal beleeve, and be everlaſtingly ſaved.</p>

               <p>BUt you wil ſay; If this be ſo, that God hath made ſuch a difference; that there are ſome that he hath been from al eternity reconcileing himſelf unto, and not al; what is the reaſon of this phraſe? why doth he ſay that he loved the world? and that he was reconciling himſelf unto the world without any diſtinction?

                  <p>Thirdly, Another Reaſon of it is this. That God might ſhew, that in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, none ſhal be excluded, No, not the worſt of ſinners that are in the world; and therefore God doth not ſay in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel; this, or that particular man or woman Chriſt died for; but generally, he died for the world. Becauſe he would hereby ſhew, that he hath not excluded the worſt, and vildeſt ſinner in the world; and that thoſe that are the moſt notorious, and the greateſt ſinners in the world may come in and be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. If God had expreſſed it thus; There are ſome in the world that I have been reconciling my ſelf unto from al eternity: Then may a ſinner ſay; ſurely, if there be but ſome, God never intended me that have been ſo wicked a wretch, ſo notorious a ſinner. But therefore God would not expreſs it ſo, but in the moſt general tearmes, to the end that there ſhould not be any one ſinner in the world have this plea: Lord, I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. No, ſaith God, I wil have the Miniſtery of my Goſpel go in ſuch generall tearmes, as that every ſinner ſhal have incouragement to come in, and receive mercy. Therefore you ſhal find in that laſt of <hi>Mark.</hi> 15. where Chriſt gives his Commiſſion to his diſciples to preach. He ſaith; <hi>go in to al the world, and</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>each <hi>the Goſpel to every Ceature;</hi> that is, to man, who is a little world, an Epitome of every creature. To the Gentiles alſo, who had been denyed this favor of the Goſpel, as if they had been none of Gods creatures. If thou beeſt a creature, the Goſpel is to be preached to thee. There is to be a general tender of Grace, and mercy to every Creature throughout the whole world, to the greateſt ſinners that live upon the face of the Earth. Great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſmal ſinners, al of them are to have the offer of Reconciliation with God; And the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to preach in the name of God, that the Lord
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46564:92"/> doth tender unto every one, this offer of mercy and Salvation. This to be done miniſterially to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſhal come preach to; not only great ſinners, but thoſe that are of the meaneſt condition in the world. For ſome may ſay; If God wil ſhew mercy to ſome in the world, ſure it muſt be to ſome great ones in the world, thoſe that are eminent, and may do him a great deal of ſervice; alas, what ſervice can God have from me a poor creature that lives al day long in a poor dark hole, that can do him no work, or ſervice; wil ever God have any thought of me? Yes, if thou be a creature of God, and liveſt in the world, thou art no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Reconciliation with God, than the Kings, and Emperors of the Earth; and it may be God may think of thee in that poor hole of thine a thatched cottage when he neglecteth, and paſſeth by the great Monarks of the world. Therefore this expreſſion is ſo large; that thoſe that are the pooreſt people in the world, and the greateſt ſinners in the world, may know, they are not excluded from the offers of grace in the Goſpel. This is a third Reaſon. And then.</p>

                  <p>A fourth Reaſon why it goes in ſuch tearmes as theſe. That herby the Lord may ſhew; that thoſe that ſhal actually come in to be reconciled unto him, they muſt come in while they are in this world. That thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are capable of Reconciliation, are only ſuch perſons as live in the world: If they be not reconciled before they are gone out of the world, they are never to be reconciled: therefore is this phraſe, God is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileing the world to himſelf. As if he ſhould ſay: If once you are gone out of the world, and are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilied unto God before you are gone, you are loſt for ever. The object of this my grace, is only thoſe people that live in the world, if they paſs away this time, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46564:93"/> be not reconciled unto me while they live here, they ſhal never be reconciled; for God was not reconciling himſelf to men that are in Hell, for they are not of this world, they are gone out of the world; they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Gods patience to live a great while in the world, and here they filled the world with ſin as much as in them lay; Now they are gone out of the world, and are gone from the ſhine of Gods grace, which ſhal never come to ſhine upon them more; they ſhal never come to hear any offer of the Goſpel more. This is a fourth Reaſon.</p>

The truth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Converſion, we do al lie in wickedneſs, as a Carrion, or a dead Dog that lies in a Cart-way, al in gore, &amp; mire; So are we in our natural Condition, and yet that the great God of Heaven ſhould ſend his own Son into the world to die for ſuch a one; that he ſhould make ſuch a one an heir of Heaven, and of eternal life; that ſuch a one ſhould become a member of his Son, and ſo have everlaſting Communion with himſelf; &amp; that this ſhould be plotted by God from al eternity; What an infinite love of God is this? And again; that the world lies in wickedneſs; the world
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46564:93"/> that is ſo vile, and ſo unworthy a thing; that yet the Lord ſhould be thus reconciling the <hi>World</hi> to himſelf; What an infinite, and unconceivable, free Grace of God is this?</p>

                  <p>The Sixt Reaſon is this. They that ſhal live in the world ſhal generally come in to God; and indeed be actually reconciled in time. Though the world for the preſent be not ſo generally reconciled unto God: yet the Lord hath his time when the Jews ſhal be called, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in, and we ſhal ſee further Reaſon of the generality of this expreſſion. God hath promiſed that Chriſt ſhal poſſeſs the utmoſt parts of the Earth, and that the Heirs of the promiſe ſhal inherit the <hi>World.</hi> I underſtand it litterally. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23. God made a promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed, that he ſhould be the Heir <hi>of the World.</hi> And this Promiſe is yet to be fulfiled in a literal ſence. In ſome ſpiritual ſence the Saints may be ſaid to be Heirs of the world: for indeed the right eſpecially belongs to them (I do not ſay but ungodly men have right by guift, he giveth the Earth to the Children of men) but not by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (as the Saints have) as Servants have a right to their meat, and drink, and what is given them: but the Children have a right by inheritance, ſo the Saints have a right to this world as wel as to Heaven, and there is a time a comming when they wil be poſſeſt with their inheritance. Then the Text wil be true literally.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly: Hence then it concerns us al to look about us while we live in this world; that there may be ſome work of God upon our hearts while we are here; that while we live in this world, we may be reconciled unto him; for if the thrid of our life be once cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and we be noe longer in this world, but go out of it without being reconciled unto God; we are undone creatures for ever. We ſay of men when they are dying; alas ſuch a one is now no man for this world; wel, they had neede then to look to themſelves that the work of Reconciliation be done before, for when thou art no longer in this world, then thou art gon for ever. O, then apply thy ſelfe to this work whilſt thou haſt time, and tak hold of the means, and oppertunities which God affords unto thee while thou art a man of this world, looſe it not; and know, it is a great mercy of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46564:95"/> God to thee to continue thee in this world; becauſe here thou art under the power of grace; thou art under that genneral grace of God that is indefinitly tendred unto every man; under that grace which hath fallen upon as great Sinners as thou art; and therefore ſo long as there is life there is hope. This point I have divers times made uſe of; to ſhew, that this time of our lives, is the time of grace, and ſalvation; and it follows naturally, and fully from the expreſſion in the text; therefore I ſhal leave it. Only let me tel you thus much, That though God expreſſeth this grace of Reconciliation here to the world; yet if ever thou beeſt actually, and indeede reconciled to God, before thou doſt leave the world, God wil make thee to be a man no more of this world, and though thou art in the world, yet thou ſhalt not be of the world but above the world. Therefore in <hi>john</hi> 17. you ſhal finde when Chriſt ſpeaks of thoſe that his father had given unto him, and had beleeved on him; he ſayeth verſe 14. and 16. I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are <hi>not of the World,</hi> even as I am not of the world; I pray not that thou ſhould'ſt take them out of the world but that ſhould'ſt keep them from the evil. It's true, when men have beleeved on Chriſt, they are in the world, and Chriſt doth not pray that God ſhould take them out of the world, but preſerve them in the world. It ſhould teach us by the way, to be content to live in the world though it be a dangerous, and an evil world; for it was as dangerouſe, and as evil a world wherein the diſciples and Chriſt lived, they were in danger of death for the profeſſion of Religion; and yet though Chriſt loved his diſciples, he would not pray they ſhould be taken out of the world.</p>
                  <p>You have a great many diſcontented people, that wil pray, that God would take them out of the world; No, ſaith Chriſt; keep them in this world. And then he ſaith, they are not of the world, Indeed God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46564:96"/> himſelf to the world; that is, to thoſe that are in the world, but being reconciled to them, they are no longer men of the world, though in the world; there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore if thou beeſt one that God the Father and the Son hath agreed upon from al eternity to be reconciled unto him in time, thou ſhalt be brought to be one not of the world, even whileſt thou liveſt in the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that are not only in the world, but are worldly men, and minde only the things of the world; know that the worke of Reconciliation is not done with your Souls; what God hath done concerning you in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe from al eternity, we know not, but as yet the work is not done upon thy ſoul, thou art not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God; that is; thou art not brought into ſuch a diſpoſition in thine own heart, as to be at peace with God; and if ever thou ſhalt have any peace at al, know it muſt be done here in this world; the work of Reconciliation muſt be done here. Thus much for that point. That God was in Chriſt reconcileing the world to himſelf.</p>

As a man that is in debt; we ſay there is ſo much ſtanding upon his Head; ſo much upon his ſcore. Now, when God is ſaid not to impute your treſpaſſes; the meaning is;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46564:96"/> your debt comes to be cancelled &amp; to be reckoned the debt of an other man; he ſets your ſins no longer upon your ſcore, but upon the ſcore of Chriſt: this is the happineſs of Beleevers: that thoſe ſins of theirs that ſtood upon their ſcoor are now taken off and ſet upon the ſcore of Chriſt. This is a bleſſed doctrine, and we cannot ſpeak of this without trembling of heart; becauſe we know how ſubject men are to abuſe it; but the Children muſt have the bread given to them, though it tend to the ruine, and deſtruction of others. You that are ſinners and go on in ſin, though you ſee it not, you run every day upon the ſcore, like ſome Gallants that come into an Inn, or into a Tavern, and there cal for Wine, and good cheer, never thinking that one is al the while they are eating, and drinking, and merry, behind the dore with a peece of Chalk ſcoring up al, and at laſt wil cal in for the payment of it. Every ſin we commit is upon the ſcore and there is a time when God wil cal for payment. You wil ſay, how is it then that God ſaith, <hi>their ſins ſhal not be imputed?</hi> Why, it is becauſe Chriſt comes, and al that is upon our ſcore is taken off, and ſet upon his, but yet the ſcore muſt be payed. So that this phraſe noteth; That the Salvation of man is not from ſuch a free pardon, as a man that is in debt ſhould have his Creditor come, and ſay, I wil quit the ſcore, I wil wipe off al, and pardon it al: No; But the way of the Salvation of man is thus; Here is a debt, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it muſt be: Only Chriſt the ſuerty comes, and he payes for ſome, and others are caſt into the priſon of Hel, where they muſt lie till they have pay'd the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt farthing; for the debt muſt be pay'd. And here is the Reaſon of the difference between Beleevers, and others. Thoſe that are damned; al the time they live, they run upon the ſcore, and at laſt God comes, and reckoneth with them for all; and then alas they have nothing to pay. Saith God to the Devil; take him Jaylor. Death is Gods Sargant to areſt him, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46564:97"/> the Devil is his Jaylor, and they have him to priſon, and there he muſt lie til he hath payed the uttermoſt farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But now Beleevers that have run upon the ſcore: In the dayes of their youth, they were ſo much upon ſcore. When they were Apprentizes; ſo much upon the the ſcore. Since they were married; ſo much upon the ſcore. Yea, but when divine juſtice is ready to ſeize upon them, and areſt them; Chriſt comes in, and ſaith he; let the man be freed, I wil pay the ſcore for him. As if a ſpend-thrift ſhould run upon the ſcore, and when he is areſted, and ready to go to the Jayle, there comes ſome freind, and ſaith; deliver him, and I wil pay the debt. So Chriſt doth. So that when our ſins are forgiven, they are ſo forgiven, as that it coſts much; our deliverance coſts much. And this I note from the phrae in the Original text; for there it is thus; <hi>not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or accounting it upon the ſcore:</hi> I have in many ſermons opened the doctrine of the pardon of ſin: therfore I do not intend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o dilate upon that. I wil only give ſome few notes from hence that are moſt proper to this text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. And the firſt is this. That there may be ſin in the ſoul, and yet not imputed, Therefore there may be a righteouſneſs imputed which is not our own, there is the ſame ground of both. Many of our adverſaries do crie out of imputation of righteouſneſs: ſay they, how can that which is none of our righteouſneſs, be made ours? for ſo it is if we beleeve, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is none of ours is made ours, how can that be, ſay they? Yes, as wel as that which is our ſin ſhal not be made our ſin, if that which is our own ſhal not be imputed, then that which is not our own may be imputed likewiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 2. Secondly: (Which is a note of marvelous Comfort) There may be a Reconciliation with God, even while there remains much ſin in the Soul. It is not ſaid thus. Reconciling the world to himſelf <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their ſins,</hi> purging out al their ſins, as if
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46564:97"/> there could be no Reconciliation til al their Sins were taken away; But he was reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>not imputing,</hi> that is the Phraſe. As if he had ſaid. O! you Sinners, ſo long as you live in the world, you wil have ſin, and therfore do not think that God is not reconciled unto you, or that you are not reconciled unto God; No, though ſin be remaining in your hearts, yet God may be reconciled unto you not imputing your ſins. This ſhould be an argument to you, to labor to purge out ſin as much as you can, ſeeing the grace of God is ſuch; that ſin remaining in you, yet God is ſtil reconciling you to himſelf: it is not ſo much to think, that God ſhould be reconciled to the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that have no ſin in them. O! but God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to his Saints upon Earth that have ſo much ſin in them; that is much. There are many of the people of God that cannot diſtinguiſh between the <hi>not imputing of ſin and being of ſin in them;</hi> they think becauſe they have much ſin in them, the Lord wil not be reconciled to them. But know thou; though ſin be in thee, yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e may be no imputation of ſin to thee, and therefore learn to diſtinguiſh between ſin being in thee, and ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not imputed to thee.</p>
               <p>And this ſhould be of Uſe to us likewiſe to teach us to be willing to be reconciled to others, notwithſtanding there are many weakneſſes in them; and though they ſtil continue to offend us. Be reconciled to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and reconciled to your Childdren, and to your Neighbors; and ſay not; I could be reconciled to them if I ſaw them changed indeed: What meaneſt thou by that? Doſt thou mean that thou may'ſt ſee no more weakneſſes in them, or that there may never be any thing in them more that offend thee; wilt thou ſtay ſo long? God doth not ſtay ſo long for thee, til he bringeth thee to Heaven, and perfecteth thee; he doth not ſtop his Reconciliation with thee til thou comeſt there, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46564:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> perfect; No, <hi>he is reconciled to thee here;</hi> even here whil'ſt thou haſt a nature in thee that bubbles out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin againſt him; and notwithſtanding the <hi>in-being of ſin in thee;</hi> yet God can diſtinguiſh between the <hi>in-being of ſin in thee, and the imputation of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 3. We ſee here is the bottom of al our Reonci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the non imputation of our Sins. It is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God is reconciled to a man, becauſe he lets him proſper in the world; or becauſe he hath been at Sea, and hath got a great deal of Riches in his Voyage; perhaps the man bleſſeth himſelf, and he thinketh, O! now al is wel between God and me, for he hath given me ſo much riches; and he bleſſed me in ſuch a Voyage: alas thou miſtakeſt if thou thinkeſt that this is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reconciliation; No, the bottom of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, is non imputation. Haſt thou an evidence to thy Soul, that God hath revealed Chriſt to thee, and that in his Son he hath imputed thy ſin to thee; and do'ſt thou build thy peace upon that? This wil hold. Many build their peace upon this; that their ſins are not ſo, and ſo great as others are, What of that; if it be but one ſin that thou art guilty of, though it be of the leaſt nature, yet if it be imputed to thee; it is enough to make thy Soul and God eternally enemies. Others there are whoſe ſins were committed a great while ago, and they have worne out the trouble of them, &amp; now they are quiet and at peace; But O! let them know there is ſtil the debt, remaining upon the ſcore, it is not taken of. And as a man that may ſtay a long while before he cals for his debt, may cal for it when he pleaſeth, and firſt, or laſt wil do it; So, thou haſt gotten thy ſelfe into a kind of peace and worne out the trouble of thy conſcience; yet know, that ſo long as thy ſins are upon the ſcore, and are not wiped off; God wil cal for payment ſooner, or latter; therefore pleace not thy ſelf in any things in the world as the ground of thy peace, but thy being reconciled unto God in Chriſt he not imputing thy ſins unto thee.</p>

I have received all power both in Heaven and in Earth, And than he tells them, Go and teach al nations, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay you are going about the greateſt work that ever any creature hath been implyed in, in this world, for ſo it is certainly, The Miniſtery of Reconciliation is next to the work of Redemption, that Chriſt was employed about is the greateſt work that any creature in this world was employed about, whatſoever the world thinks of it, no Angel in heaven was ever employed about a greater work then this, and therefore being of ſo great conſequence, Chriſt makes this preface; Al power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, go ye therefore, as if Chriſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46564:100"/> ſhould ſay, Be it knowen to you now, that the power that is given to me by the Father, ſhal go along with you and therefore be encouraged, but they might wel have ſaid, who is ſufficient for theſe great things?

Yeares agoe, and yet Chriſt ſaith he wil be with them to the end of the world, that is with thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them in the Minniſtery of Reconciliation, This is the commiſſion, And when they come to any houſe they are to begin thus, You ſhal ſay Peace be to you when they come to any place, that is the peace of God in Chriſt. Now this doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is that that muſt be underſtood by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We can read but very little of it, ſcarce one letter in all the book of the creature, we cannot come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it by any knowledg of our own, but it muſt be
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46564:101"/> taught us, no, nor by the creature, But thus much may be underſtood by the creatures, Gods continuing to the world, and ſhining upon the juſt as wel as upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and abundance of Mercy heer doth this declare with a loude voice, that there is ſome poſſibility for men to be reconciled unto God, there is mercy for mankind, there doth ſeem to be a loude voice in the goodneſs of God in the creature to ſound out in the eares of al the world that man is in a better condition than the Devills, for certainly, if God had no intention to do good unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he would not continue ſo many Mercies as he doth; But now this cannot ſhew us what is Chriſt; but it may ſhew us thus much, that God hath a way of mercy for the Children of men, and I think in part, that text may be meant of this that we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. Where the Appoſtle ſpeaks concerning the Goſpel, <hi>but I ſay have they not heard? Yes verily their ſound went into al the world,</hi> have they not heard of the Goſpel that is here ſpoken of, Hath not <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard the Goſpel? Yes verily, their ſound went into all the Earth, and their words unto the end of the world. And this text if you compare it with the 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> We may have cauſe to wonder much at the quotation of it, and there you have it a little different, as in the verſ. 4. their Line (that is, the great characcter of the Grace of God that is written in the book of the creature, as it were in a line,) that is gone out throught the earth, and hath a kind of ſound in it, at leaſt we may ſee it written, but hence you ſee in the 19. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> It is clerly ſpoken concerning the works of God, In the Sun, and in the Heavens, The Heavens declare the glory of God and the firmant ſhews his handy work. The creature hath a loude voice to cal us to God by repentance, now there can be no calling of us to Repentance, but it is a voice of the Goſpel, And the Apoſtle ſaith plainly in the 2 of <hi>Rom. That the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God calls us to Repentance,</hi> in verſe, 4. what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever leades to Repentance hath ſomething of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46564:101"/> Goſpel in it, Patience and goodneſs, though we never come to heare of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, yet it is that that calls us to repentance, and it is cleare in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is ſpoken of in the creature; the loude voice in the creature in the 19 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> it is applied to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and except you underſtand it ſo, we cannot tel you that the ſound of the Goſpel hath gon to the utmoſt parts of the earth. We cannot underſtand in the Apoſtles time, how the Goſpel went to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the world, for there are many places that are not found out yet, but this kind of ſound of the Goſpel goes throughout the earth, that by the voice of the creatures men ought to come to know thus much, that ſurely there is ſome way for God to be pacified towards ſinful men, though they cannot tell which way, or what way, ſuerly there is ſome way, and many of the Jewes knew no other way but this, they knew there was a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah to come, but what he was; or who he was, they know very little of him. Now the Devills have no ſuch work of God towards them, nor ſuch bounty and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and goodneſs towards them whereby they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God hath any thoughts to be reconciled to them, Though its true, they are not yet fully under the torment that they ſhal be, yet they are under ſo much torment as they are ſaid to be reſerved to the great day in chains of darkneſs, whereas wicked and ungodly men are preſerved by the bounty and patience of God, and the cords of Gods bounty and mercy is towards them, and therefore they are not reſerved in chaines of darkneſs as the Devil and damned are; So that by the bounty of God in the creature we may gather ſuch a concluſion, that ſurely God hath ſome way to ſhew mercy unto mankind, But we can never have any thoughts by any works of God in his creature, that God ſhould ſend the ſecond perſon in Trinity to take mans nature upon him, to die, to ſuffer for mans ſin, to tender up ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, and then al muſt be brought into this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46564:102"/> Covenant, &amp; then he muſt be the head of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and they muſt be made Members of his body; now the Creature hath no ſuch miſttry as this, and therefore in the 3 <hi>Eph.</hi> 8. verſe, ſaith the Apoſtle (ſpeaking what his miniſtery was) unto me who am the leaſt of al Saints is the grace given that I ſhould preach amongſt the gentils the <hi>unſearchable riches</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>NOw it is to be enquired after, Firſt, why God would chooſe men rather, to be the diſpencers of of the great Myſtery of Reconciliation then the Angels? God hath not committed unto them this word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation (though it is true the Angels they do go about, and they ſomtimes witneſs to the Goſpel) as you may read afterwards) But they are not choſen by way of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Miniſtery of the Goſpel; that is not the office they are appointed to, ſo as the Miniſters of the Goſpel are; God hath not choſen Angels in an ordinary way to come and diſpence thoſe great and glorious things unto the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay, had it not been better that God ſhould have choſen the Angels to come in and preach Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, than men? for they are poor weak Creatures, and like our ſelves, and now when they come to ſtand up and Preach Jeſus Chriſt, the great things about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling men to God, ſhould we think that they know more then we ourſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt not think that there is no good to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46564:103"/> be done till one comes and tels you that you never heard of.</p>
               <p>But you muſt know; that it is by vertue of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt: becauſe he hath appointed a Miniſter of the Goſpel to come, and in ſuch a way to preach, though the inſtrument be like your ſelves, and perhaps may not have a deeper underſtanding then ſome of you, yet you are to look upon it beyond the matter that he ſpeaks, you are to look upon it as the ordinance of Chriſt, and ſo to expect, and look at al means whatſoever. But now the great ſtanding ordinance in the Church of God is the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, It is this that is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us to Preach, and this therefore is to be looked upon as the power of God to ſalvation in thoſe that God intends Salvation to: God hath not choſen the Angels, but Men, and upon this reaſon, becauſe we are not ſo capable of converſing with Angels as men; we are not able to ſtand before them; when an Angel hath ſomtimes appeared to a gratious Servant of God he hath not been able to bear the glory of it, but to fal down, and when the Angels came in the 2 of <hi>Luk.</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Glory to God on high</hi> &amp;c. The Angels ſtruck the Shephards with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And in the ſecond place, the Miniſtrey of the Angels could not be ſo effectual, Angels do not ſo fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the windings &amp; turnings of the hearts of men ſo as men do, A Man is more conſcious to the turnings and windings of his own heart then any Angel can be, he may know his own heart more then Angels can, and by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own heart he may be able to ſpeak more ſuitable; we do not in read the word that Angels knew the thoughts of the heart of men any further then they are ſome way expreſt; nor the Devils. That is made to be the property of God, to be the ſearcher of the heart; but a Man may ſearch his own heart in a great meaſure fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Angels, and ſo they may the better ſpeak unto the hearts of others, and ſo God in Wiſdome
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46564:103"/> rather commits the Miniſtery of Reconciliation to men then Angels.</p>
               <p>But a third is this, and that is a ſpecial one, that the power of God may the more appeare in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſouls unto Jeſus Chriſt; and in this one thing, the power of God doth appear a great deal more then in making Heaven, and Earth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Doctrine of Reconciliation, is the moſt high ſupernatural thing that is in the world, it is above the reach of a creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is that that doth beat down mans nature as much as can be, But now that a few poor fiſher men at firſt, to whom was committed the word of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and a few of the Apoſtles that were in a poore meane contemptible condition, that ſometimes had ſcarce raggs to hang upon them, were whipt up &amp; down, &amp; put in the ſtocks as if they had been the vileſt Rogues that had been in all the world, and yet that God ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſo many nations upon the face of the earth, and in time ſhould bring the whole world in general to receive this Doctrine by ſuch poor and weak meanes, O! the infinite power and glory of God that doth appeare. In this God uſes weak meanes, to ſhew the greatneſs of his power, and for that you have a cleare text in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 7. But we have this treaſure in <hi>Earthen Veſſels,</hi> that is the Miniſtery of Reconciliation. O! it is a treaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in earthen veſſels, the word is in the greek, in veſſels of ſhells, there were ſome rich ſhells, that had on the outſide a plaine ſhel, that when you came to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore you ſhould look upon them, and they looked meanly as if they had not been worth a farthing, but within the ſhel there was a pretious Pearle that was worth many thouſands of pounds, ſo ſaith he, we have this treaſure in a ſhel, that is in a poor weak fraile veſſel man, a contemptible veſſel we have this pearle, And why ſo? the Apoſtle gives the reaſon, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the power may be of God, and not of us. There
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46564:104"/> is a mighty power of God that goes together with the Miniſtery of Reconciliation. Whenſoever any ſoul is brought home to be reconciled unto God, certainly there goes a mighty power, yea, there goes an hyperbolical power together with it.</p>
               <p>Object, <hi>But how wil this appeare, that there is ſuch a mighty power of God that goes with the Miniſtery of Reconciliation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appeares in this, that there is ſuch mighty things done by ſuch poor weak and contemptible means that men ſhould be willing to part with any thing in the world, yea their very lives, and beare the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt cruel Tyrants, and that for the witneſs of this truth. Now this appeares to be the mighty power of God, and this ſeemes to be a ſecret anſwer to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> Is it ſo that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are far more Glorious then the Miniſters of the Law? What is the reaſon that the Miniſters of the Goſpel are in ſuch a meane condition, ſo much meaner then the Miniſters of the Law? There was an high Prieſt, and he had glorious Robes, and had pretious ſtones upon his breſt and ſhoulders, now we have no ſuch things, Here is a company of poor Fiſher-men, weak meane men that the world regards not, ſuerly the Miniſters of the Law were more Glorious then theſe Miniſters of the Goſpel. No ſaith the Apoſtle for al this, we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels that the excellency of the power of God might appeare, and not of man, and we are willing (as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay) that the power of God may appeare more, that the glory of God may ſhine bright, we are willing to be Earthen Veſſels.</p>
               <p>Another Reaſon may be this, why God committs this Miniſtery to poor <hi>[Men]</hi> rather than to Angels; ſurely God hath a further end then wee imagine, it is (in juſt judgment) to be a ſtumbling block to wicked, and ungodly men, whoſe hearts are oppoſite unto the Glorious Goſpel; that (as we know) Chriſt ſaid he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46564:104"/> preached in parables, <hi>that in ſeeing they might not ſee, and in hearing they might not underſtand;</hi> as a juſt judgment of God againſt the Phariſees, and others whoſe hearts were wicked, and unclean, and oppoſite unto Chriſt, that the glorious things of the Goſpel might be hid under thoſe parables. So I make no queſtion but the means of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, (which the world counts Fooliſhneſs) and the mean condition of the profeſſors of the Goſpel is made by God as a ſtumbling block to ungodly men, who God intends ſhould periſh eternally, becauſe their hearts are wicked and perverſe, &amp; I hate them (ſaith God) therefore wil hide this rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from them; But thoſe that I love, I wil open the inſide unto them, but others ſhal have nothing but the outſide, they ſhal only have the viſible part. But now there are others whom God intends to ſave, and they come, and the Lord (together with their outward Miniſtery) ſpeaks to their hearts, and opens the inward treaſure to them, and they ſe the Glory of it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at it, and they come to taſt the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel, and they adore God in receiving ſuch things as theſe are: ſo that God fetches about his ends this way, but (in his juſt judgment) hides his Goſpel from ſome, and reveales it to others, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> the miniſtery of the Goſpel it is hid to ſome, but it is to thoſe that are loſt; he hides it from them by this outward meanes, the outſide; Thus you ſee why God doth commit the Miniſtery of Reconciliation unto men rather then unto Angells.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. 41.</hi> Why God wil not himſelf immediatly diſpute this Goſpel Reconciliation.</head>
               <p>BUT further, it may be ſaid; why wil not God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately himſelf preach this Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, The Miſtery of Reconciliation? we ſee many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in men; Men are ready enough to ſtumble at al infirmities of the Miniſters of the Goſpel (which by the way ſhould teach Miniſters of the Goſpel to have a care how they walk) but becauſe there are ſo many things to be excepted againſt men we would be ready to think, if God would himſelf preach the goſpel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men would regard it more.</p>
               <p>No, but God wil not do ſo, though God wil aſſiſt the Miniſtery to make it effectual in the hearts of thoſe that ſhal be ſaved; yet he wil not ſpeak himſelf from Heaven, but he wil ſend men like themſelves, and let men hear or not, and howſoever, (though men think, if God ſhould ſpeak himſelf they would hear him) yet if they heare not men, they would not hear God. God ſpake himſelf from heaven in the delivering of the Law, but men did not keep the Law; but now God wil rather ſpeak by men; becauſe he doth delight to make uſe of every creature according to the capacity of it. The Lord takes a wonderful delight in the uſe of almeans that is ſuiteable to a creature, And therefore you ſhal find (which is very obſerveable) that though God did begin to ſpeak from Heaven to <hi>Saul</hi> that he did convert (who afterwards was called <hi>Paul</hi>) Chriſt ſpake at firſt from Heaven, but mark, he would not do the whol work himſelf immediately; but before the work ſhould be accompliſhed there ſhould be meanes
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46564:105"/> uſed in <hi>Acts,</hi> 9.4. There Chriſt ſpeaks from Heaven; but I beſeech you obſerve it, what doth Chriſt ſpeak from Heaven? he doth not preach the goſpel; it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the word of conviction <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> This was enough to ſtrike <hi>Saul</hi> with aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment ſo that he fell upon the earth, and ſaid Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? But mark, what anſwer is given him? <hi>Go into the Citty and it ſhal be told thee.</hi> You muſt not think though I begin to ſpeak from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, but that you muſt be content to ſet upon means, and ſo he did with <hi>Saul, he aroſe from the Earth</hi> in verſe, 8. God made him ſtay a good while before he would tel him what he ſhould do; he was three dayes and nights and eate nothing, and was praying al the while unto the Lord, and then in verſ, 10. Saith the Lord to <hi>Ananias</hi> (a Miniſter of his) Go to ſuch a place, and there thou ſhalt open to <hi>Saul</hi> my Mercy: this Doctrine of Reconciliation. It is true, I begin to think upon him; but I wil not go on in the work; you ſhal do it, and he ſhal attend upon your Miniſtery to let him know, what my mercy in Chriſt to his Soul is, and I wil bleſs your Miniſtery unto his Soul.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee how God ſtands upon the making uſe of the meanes, I make no queſtion but it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to Gods dealing with many of you; though God at firſt begins himſelf, and ſtrikes ſome terror into your hearts. A man when he is going about his buſineſs, he hath ſome ſuddaine thought dents into his heart, Lord where am I? What if I ſhould now die? how can I anſwer for ſuch and ſuch things before God? And thus perhaps he comes to be troubled in his Conſcience by ſome immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate work of God, but he wil not go on in this work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but he ſends him to the Miniſters of his word, and there he ſhews him what he muſt do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his good; I wil give you a notable text to ſhew you how God ſtands upon means; in <hi>Act.</hi> 10.2. He
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46564:106"/> had ſome kind of the fear of God, but underſtood little of Chriſt; he was a ſouldier, a Centurion of the band called the Italian band; he had a greate many ſouldiers that were wicked, but yet he had ſome that were godly: But though he was in that place, yet he was a devout man and ful of prayer, (as it is commendable for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be much in prayer,) becauſe carrying his life in his hands, he had need carry Grace in his heart, and then in the 3. verſe, (it is a very obſervable Scripture) firſt, God accepts of his prayers, and appeares in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, and ſends an Angel to him, and tels him that his prayers were accepted wel, but God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſo much of Chriſt to him which he was very ignorant of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You wil ſay, ſeing God did ſend an Angel to him, why did not God reveal Chriſt by the Angel? No, he would not, he ſends an Angel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> to this end, to bid him ſend for <hi>Peter</hi> that was a Miniſter of the Goſpel; This ſhould be the meſſage of the Angels, to tel him that God regarded his prayers, and almes. I but, as if the Angel ſhould ſay, God hath other things to tel you; but the truth is I have no commiſſion to tel you, my commiſſion is to tel you that you ſhould ſend for a Miniſter, he ſent for <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> came and Preacht Chriſt unto him; as you may ſee in verſe, 34. ſo that you may ſee that God doth uſe to work upon men by means, and ſurely, herein God wil honor humane nature in taking it upon himſelf, and for Gods honoring of the Miniſter of his word, take this one note (which is likewiſe very obſervable) that Chriſt himſelf when he Preacht upon the Earth, we never read that his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was ſo efficatious to convert ſo many Souls, as the Miniſters of the Goſpel did; <hi>Peter</hi> when he came to preach the Goſpel, Converted three thouſand Souls at one Sermon, and you never read that Chriſt converted ſo many at a Sermon, Chriſt himſelf preaching imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the Goſpel did never convert ſo many as <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:46564:106"/> did; The reaſon is to ſhew, that we muſt not expect ſo much the immediate preaching of God unto us; as God and Chriſt preaching to us by the Miniſtery of Man; that is the meaning of it: ſo that now you have had the point opened unto you; that God committs unto us the Miniſtery of Reconciliation.</p>

They come to treat with your ſouls about Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and God hath appointed this the greate means of bringing ſouls unto himſelfe, to be reconciled unto himſelfe, and therefore it is one of the greateſt bleſſings in the world to have the mineſtry of the goſpel in any congregation. <hi>Bleſſed be your eyes ſaith Chriſt that you ſee ſuch things,</hi> and your ears that you heare ſuch things, that God hath diſpoſed you to live in thoſe times wherein you have the mighty things of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the goſpel ſhewed unto you; it is a good argument that god hath many ſouls to be reconciled unto when he ſends the miniſters of the goſpel unto a place, and therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> was going from a place, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in the night, and bid him be of good courage and ſaith unto him, I have many ſouls in this City. When God in a ſpecial manner ſends the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46564:107"/> of the goſpel into a place let them bleſs God from their ſouls, and take it as an argument that ſure God hath many ſouls in this place that he intends to be reconciled unto, for the minniſtry of the goſpel is the minniſtry of reconciliation; it is the fruit of the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, and for that compare thoſe ſcriptures together and it wil be clear; in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49 8. this is quoted in <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.2. now what is that? that is, when <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching to them, and he makes this the fulfilling of that prophecy in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49. now it is clear, that, that prophecy is a prophecy of Chriſts praying to God the father; for thoſe that did belong to his election, that in due time they might have the doctrin of reconciliation opened to them; now ſaith God I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> now is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time, ſo that at any time when you come to heare a ſermon, and hear the doctrine of Reconciliation opened to you; you ſhould think thus much, This morning, or this day have I had the fruit of the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt for this congregation, and for my part in partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular Chriſt was praying unto his father for this long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was borne, and now do I come to have the fruit of the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt; This very ſound of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in my ears this morning, it is no other but the fruit of the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt unto God the father long before I had a being and the world was.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, Hence appears the great honor of the Miniſters of the Goſpel in their Miniſtery; we wil not attribute to our perſons, but to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46564:107"/> our work, certainly, if they are committed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of reconciliation, they are ſent about the moſt honorable buſineſs that ever was in the world; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence unto the Children of men the great miſtery of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. So if a Miniſter be faith free in it, it may be ſaid of any one that God uſes in this; Happy that ever he was born, and bleſſed be the womb that beare him and the paps that gave him ſuck, if ſo be he be faithful in this his work; for he is imployed about the greateſt buſineſs that is in the world; never did God employ Angels in a work of greater conſequence, and in a work wherein they are more honored they are called in ſcripture Angels of the Churches, for indeed their work is Evangelical, and when he ſpeaks of them in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Therefore let a man account of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the miſteries of</hi> God. Bretheren, we could be willing, that for our perſons they ſhould be never ſo contemptible before you if ſo be the contemptibleneſs of our perſons might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the glory of our work, But we know ordinarily, that the contempt of perſons hinders the honor of the work, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, let a man ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the Miſteries of God: we are appointed ſtewards of the miſteries of God, we are ſtewards to deal out unto you the miſteries of life, and Salvation, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was accounted highly off, when he did deale out the Corne in Egypt, and now this work of reconciliation is that that the Angells prie into, the Angels learne inſtruction from this miſtery of reconciliation, it doth, not only beſeem the greateſt men in the world to attend upon it: but the Angels themſelves honor it, and learne by it. I wil give you a text for this becauſe it may ſeem to be hard unto you, the text is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3 <hi>verſe,</hi> 10. <hi>To the intent, that now unto Principalities, and Powers in Heavenly places might be known by the Churches the manifold wiſdom of God;</hi> that (not only men) but the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46564:108"/> very Angels in heaven might come to underſtand further the wiſdom of God in Chriſt, made knowen to the Church, certainly; if the Angels come to know further by the Church, then ſpecially at their Church meetings when they are together, and when there is the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel among the Saints; then when the Church is in their exerciſes of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church; then they come to know the manifold wiſdom of God (howſoever ſome think it is fooliſhneſs) yet God ſaith, it is a manifold wiſdom of God and the Angels think ſo too. Certainly, there is no place ſo ful of ſinners, as of Angels heareing; therefore, you may wel come to heare, for the Angels they come to heare, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith to women, that they ſhould beheave themſelves wel <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Angels,</hi> and the ſcripture tells us, that the Angels prie into this miſtery of the Goſpel. Miniſters need not ſeeke honor to themſelves any wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, but by their faithful adminiſtration of the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the primitive times, the Miniſters of the Goſpel were mightily honored of the people, let a ſoul come to underſtand what it is to have peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt, through any Miniſters, Miniſtery, and that ſoul wil honor that Miniſtery enough; hee needs not cal for any honor and reſpect from that poor ſoul, It is ſaid, that in the former times <hi>there were wooden challices and golden Miniſters:</hi> but afterwards <hi>there were golden cupps, and wooden Miniſters.</hi> It was a great deale more honor to the Church when there were golden Miniſters, but afterwards when there were golden cups &amp; miniſters were gallants, and had great means, may they not wel be called wooden in reſpect of their opening of the miſteries of Salvation to the pople? It is not now ſo much for to preach morallity, (theſe are good things to be preacht on) but where is the great point of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? The great point that al Miniſters ought to aim at is the great point of Reconciliation, and that is to be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46564:108"/> preacht, and it is their commiſſion to preach that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Oh, how is it to be received, to be accepted? To us is committed the miniſtery of reconciliation; what is it? It is ſuch a miniſtery, of no leſs conſequence then your reconciliation with God; Oh how gladly ſhould you take in this miniſtery? for they come about a work that is worthy of al acception, as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of al acceptation that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners;</hi> This is the ſum of the miniſtery of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, when we come to bring this unto you, we do not expect al acceptation, to open your hearts and hands to receive in this work of reconciliation into you: as we read of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he was toſſed up and down the Sea) after many dayes he put forth a dove, and ſhe brought in an Olive branch, Now this you know is an Embleme of peace, <hi>Noah</hi> opened the window of the Arke, and took in the Dove with the Olive branch, and al thoſe that come to preach the Goſpel unto you, they come with the Olive branch in their mouths, and the truth is, you are, as it were upon the Sea floting up, and down, and we come unto you: with an Olive branch in our mouthes like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, Oh, then open your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and receive it, ſaith the prophet, Oh how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the feet of them that bring good tidings of peace, and as you read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Their very feet ſhould be beautiful unto you;</hi> It is ſo prophecied of among the Prophets, and it is made uſe of in the new Teſtament, and if you find your hearts opened and accepting of it, and rejoyce and bleſs God for it, then you fulfil that propheſie, and then the feet of thoſe meſſengers are beautiful in your eyes; that is the work that you ſhould come for when you come to hear a Sermon; You ſhould think, this day am I comming to hear ſomewhat of the work of reconciliation between God and my ſoul, and when people come to the word to expect ſomthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this peace with God, and when they heare any
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46564:109"/> ſuch thing, Oh, then they ſhould bleſs the name of God. Some come to the word to hear ſome witty ſentences, and for diſcourſe (though the maine thing is that you ſhould come to hear ſomthing about the reconciliation of God to your ſouls, and you ſhould watch for ſuch a word al: the while the miniſter is opening the point, Oh! but when wil the word of peace be opened from God to my ſoul? And when you hear that word, Oh! you ſhould embrace it, and receive it as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. I <hi>wil hearken what the Lord wil ſay, for he wil ſpeak peace unto my ſoul;</hi> ſo ſhould every poor afflicted conſcience ſay, I wil hearken this day when Chriſt wil ſpeak peace to my ſoul. The Lord by his word ſpeak peace unto you and make that which we preach in opening the things of the Goſpel to bee a powerful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of reconciliation unto your ſouls.</p>

               <p>I have treated about what commiſſion is given unto the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and there is one great thing that I would have you obſerve, that we take no notice of; how the Apoſtle again &amp; again ſpeaks of this, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account that it is one of the greateſt things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the world that ever was; for ſaith he in v. 18. <hi>Al things are of God; who hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; hath given unto us the Miniſtery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi> But he had not enough of that, but he comes over it again to wit; <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconcileing the world;</hi> that God reconciled us to himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; hath given unto us the Miniſtery of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the 18. v. that is; God is reconciling himſelf unto the world in Jeſus Chriſt, again the ſame is in the 19. verſe, <hi>And hath Committed unto us the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> ſhewing, that it is a matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; it is a great truſt that is commited to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46564:109"/> of the Goſpel, the word of Reconciliation; and there I ſhewed you, how you were (therefore) to enertain the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; beautiful ſhould the Feet be of thoſe that bring glad tidings &amp;c. That comes from God with this Commiſſion, this Doctrine of Reconciliation in their mouths as <hi>Noah</hi> put forth his hand and took in the Dove with the Olive branch: So when a Miniſter comes with this Olive leafe in his Mouth, the Miniſtry of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, you muſt open your hearts, and take it in. A word or two more about this, This (you have heard at large) is the great work of the miniſters of the Goſpel; to bring unto you the Doctrine of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: howſoever it may be foliſhneſs before the world, yet it is the great Ordinance whereby God wil bring men to be reconciled unto himſelf; thoſe that he hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſave. Here is now a work, to treat with you about reconciling your Souls to God; to open to you the Counſels of God about bringing you to be at peace with him.</p>

                  <p>Hence then ſee, what a wicked and wretched world is this, that cannot bear the Miniſters of the Goſpel? When this is al the work that they come about; this errand unto them in the name of God, to treat with them only to make peace between God and their Souls; here is al the Errand, and yet the world cannot bear this. If they came as the Meſſengers of Gods wrath againſt them, then indeed the world might look ſourly upon them, and ſeek to avoid them; but when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout no other Errand, but meerly to treat with their Souls about terms of peace that the world ſhould not recceive them, but reject the Goſpel, and deſpiſe it, and look upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel as if they were their greateſt enemies. This is a moſt wretched
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46564:110"/> wicked world, and there is nothing in the world that can aggravate the ſins of menmore then this; that they ſhould reject the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. Saith God, What? when I ſhal ſend the Minſters of the Goſpel, my ſervants to treat with theſe wretched Creatures about making peace between me and them, and they ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this; certainly God expects that whereſoever he ſends the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, generally al people ſhould admire at the grace of God, that is made known to them in Chriſt, and they ſhould al come in and even cry to God; Lord, What is it thou doſt require? what? Is there any Meſſenger from Heaven come? Now let us give up our hearts as a blank paper; let God write in them whatſoever he pleaſeth, (he doth not expect that men ſhould riſe in a rage againſt the word, and caſt it of as that that brings trouble upon them) how infinitely are men mtſtaken in this? to think that the preaching of the Goſpel is a trouble to the world, to whom it is the greateſt happineſs that can be in this world. And if you knew it, you would bleſs God for it; even with your faces groveling upon the ground, that ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was given to your brethren to come from God, to treat in his name about termes of Reconciliation with you, the Sons of men, What hurt is it the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel do unto men? that they ſhould be ſo troubled with them? as to ſay, that the Town or place is troubled and we could never be at quiet, ſince there was ſuch and ſuch preaching, were there not infinite mallice; it could never enter into the hearts of men ſuch a conceit as this is.</p>
                  <p>You ſpeak about treating of peace with God; but they are ſevere, and denounce the Judgments of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to you how doe wee denounce them? do we denounce them abſolute? or only in order to the bringing of the ſouls to faith and repentance? what do wee plead againſt? It is but againſt your ſin that is your enemy,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46564:110"/> your deadly enemy; that would certainly undo you; that would deſtroy you eternally. <hi>Ahab</hi> ſpeakes of the prophet, <hi>hee never ſpeakes good unto me;</hi> and yet ſaith Ahab, <hi>have</hi> I <hi>found thee O mine enemy?</hi> he looks upon the prophet as an enemy; ſo, wicked carnal hearts, (though we come to open the miſteries of the goſpel to them; yet when we ſhew them upon what termes it runnes) they think we do not ſpeak good unto them. Certainly (whatſoever your thoughts are) we are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to nothing but your ſins, that would deſtroy you; that is your enemy, and would any one think it hard, to have his deadly enemy to be hardly dealt withal? Al that we deſire, is; but to break the league between your ſouls and Sin, that there may bee a league between God and your ſouls: certainly love of ſin, and peace with God they cannot ſtand together at the ſame time; it cannot poſſibly be that there ſhould be a league between ſin and your ſoules, and yet a league between God and your ſoules; now which of the two do you thinke is the beſt, and who is your greateſt friend? either he that ſeekes to maintain a league with ſin or to break it that you may have a league between God, and your ſouls? this is the intention of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But you wil ſay, if this be the commiſſion of the miniſters, that God hath put into them the word of Reconciliation; why do they preach the law ſo much as they do? why do they preach terror ſo much? for this is their commiſſion; the word of Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, certainly he is a miniſter that knows not his commiſſion that preaches the law, or any terror any other way, but in order to this word of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any other way but to make you to underſtand this word of Reconciliation, (though there be (in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) a great deale of difference betweene the law, and the goſpel) yet moſt people thinke it greater than it is, for the ſubſtance of the law, (is that that is implyed (at leaſt) in the goſpel [implied] as thus) when we ſay [the

I appeal to any of you (conſidering that God works with creatures according to the nature of creatures, he doth uſe to worke (though above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) yet in a rational way; he begins the work with thoſe whom he intends to ſave: therefore how can wee (in a rational way) tel what Reconciliation is; until we underſtand what an enmity ſin hath made between God, and our ſouls. Is it poſſible to underſtand the ſweetnes of peace with God until we underſtand the danger of our eſtats that that we ſpeake of the law, it is that? that is implyed in the goſpel, and that the revealing of the goſpel may come with a more ſweetneſs, and fulneſs into your hearts; O! that you would but carry this along with you ever when you hear any of the miniſters ſpeak any thing to you that hath any terror in it; do but perſwade your ſouls of this; O! but this is in order to my peace with God; in order to ſhewe what a bleſſed and ſweet ſavior Jeſus Chriſt is.</p>

                     </gap> that I anſwer but in a word, when we ſpeak to you concerning war, what is our aime? what doth it tend to? But only this; that you may be willing to venture your ſelves, your lives and eſtates to maintain among you this word of Reconciliation; here is the end, were it not for this, we could quickly
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46564:111"/> hold our mouths, we ſhould not hazard our ſelves ſo as we do to ſpeake to you of ſuch an argument; we are apparently, and any man (whoſe eyes are but halfe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en) may ſee that if we be ſluggiſh, and cowardly now, farewel the word of Reconciliation, the word of the Goſpel is gone, we muſt not expect that that muſt be amongſt us, and the poſterity that is comming after. It may be ſome of you may know, that ſince God hath called a Parliament, and bleſſed it, as he hath don, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the word of Reconciliation opened ſo clearly as it hath been: there hath Been ſome kinde of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before with a deal of mixtures: but for that clear way of Reconciliation, your conſciences may tel you that is hath not been ſo cleerly opened.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But you wil ſay, the Apoſtles they had the word of Reconciliation, and preached it to the people; but they did not preach to the people that they ſhould maintain it by force of armes, But they taught people to ſuffer, and to lay downe their lives, and not to take the ſword into their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This hath been anſwered again and again, and it is a moſt vain objection of the people. This objection ſeemes to be ſtrengthned partly from the thing it ſelfe: They ſay, religion ſhould not be maintained by the ſword, and ſecondly, the example of the primitive tims.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for religion, know, that the maintenance that is now by the ſword in this cauſe, it is not meerly for religion, but it is for our civil right, that we have to our religion. And this anſwer wil anſwer both.</p>
                  <p>For the Objection, that <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould not be maintained by the ſword, and that of the primitive time, I ſay, [the maintenance now of Religion] it is not for that (only) that the ſword is taken up; the ſword is not taken up meerly for that, (as Religion) but for the civil right that we have to our Religion, which in the the primitive times, the Apoſtles had not, nor the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then: but now we live in ſuch a Country wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46564:112"/> we have civil right unto our Religion, as wel as to our eſtates; we have not only right unto the profeſſion of our Religion, (becauſe God gives it us out of his good wil) but we have it too by vertue of a civil right; by vertue of the Law of our common wealth: Look what right you have to your Houſes, Lands, and Eſtates; you have the ſame right to your practice of Religion; This is the mercy of God towards <hi>England,</hi> rather than to other Countries; Now we take up Arms to defend our civil right, and let it be in what it wil be, either to our Eſtates, or Houſes, or Religion, or whatſoever it be, ſtil it is a civil right; this is that that juſtifies this quarrel, and this is enough to ſtop the Mouths of any in this point, and to anſwer that argument about the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times. But I let this paſs and come unto the next verſe.</p>

               <p>NOW we are <hi>Embaſſadors.</hi> Mark, what riſe the holy Apoſtle takes, ſaith he, God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf; not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed to us this word of Reconciliation. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</hi> His ſpirit ſeems to be much moved in this; What? God reconciling the world unto himſelf? not imputing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46564:112"/> their treſpaſſes unto them? [Now then we we are Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors for Chriſt] now then we have a great truſt; now then we have a great charge; now then we are Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, not from any earthly great Prince, but from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. So that in theſe words you have theſe ſeveral points of Doctrine. I might caſt them into theſe ſeveral concluſions.</p>
               <p>Doct. Firſt, <hi>That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are Embaſſadors of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What they do in this their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage; It is as if God, and Chriſt did it, as though God did beſeech you by us, ſo we pray you in Chriſts ſtead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Conſideration of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Commiſsion, and Embaſſage makes them wonderful careful to do what they are ſent about, and very earneſt in plying the work they are ſent to do; Now we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That God and Jeſus Chriſt are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding willing to be reconciled unto Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that is the Fourth thing which is indeed the principal thing in the Text that is recorded. Now as the very ground of al that is intended in the Text.</p>
               <p>That God and Chriſt is exceeding willing that ſinners ſhould come in to be reconciled to him, <hi>for they do pray and beſeech you.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:46564:113"/>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>That the work of the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, it is (by al the means they can) to labor to draw a people by entreating and beſeeching them, and to take no nay of the hearts of the people until they do get them to come in, to be reconciled unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the five things of the 20. verſe.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhal but briefly treat of the firſt three, for indeed the two latter are the cheif, which I choſe this text for, To ſhew you the willingneſs of God that ſinners ſhould come in and be reconciled to him, and the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is to draw the hearts of the people; But the other three I ſhal ſpeak of but by way of preface unto theſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are the Embaſſadors of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Not Embaſſadors for Belial, or for Antichriſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters have been, to plead the cauſe of Antichriſt, as if they were ſent as Legates from <hi>Rome;</hi> and to plead for ſuperſtitious vanities; we are not Embaſſadors for Belial, for ſin, for wickedneſs, for many times you heare pleading againſt Godlineſs, and for wickedneſs: No, we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, we are ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors; this is ſomething more than meſſengers; this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46564:113"/> is a higher degree than to be a bare meſſenger, an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is more than a ſteward; in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Therefore let a man ſo account of us as the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpencers of the miſteries of Salvation.</hi> I only wil ſhew you a ſcripture for that, and a little open it, and ſoon paſs by this point.</p>
               <p>We have it often in ſcripture, this word <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> In <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. There you have it to the ſame purpoſe as it is here; <hi>For which I am an Embaſſador,</hi> and he is in bonds. He was not uſed like an Embaſſador, you know, [Embaſſadors,] Firſt they are ſuch as are ſent from Princes and States, to other Princes and States: it is not a private man. If any of you ſend a meſſenger about a buſineſs, he is not ſaid to be an Embaſſador; but one that comes from a Prince, or State from other countries, he is ſaid to be an Embaſſador. So the Miniſter of the Goſpel, he is not ſent to deale between man and man: but between God and man, in matters that concern the great God of Heaven, and Earth; and ſent from him, though deſigned to it by men, yet their calling depends upon God, upon Chriſt, only here is the difference; when Princes, and States, ſend their Embaſſadors; they ſend them to other Princes, and to other States: But now God ſends Embaſſadors to poor wretched, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, and herein he doth honor man, that he wil ſend a meſſenger from himſelfe to them to be an Embaſſador. When a Prince doth ſend a meſſenger to a perſon, you do not ſay, that the Prince doth ſend an Embaſſador to them that are in priſon, that he may execute when he pleaſes, rather an Executioner, than an Embaſſador: So we might al have expected rather that there ſhould an Executioner have been ſent, but God is pleaſed for his elect ones to ſend an Embaſſador. And beſides, Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are not ſent about every trivial buſineſs, but when an Embaſſador is ſent, it is about a publique buſineſs, a State buſineſs of ſome great conſequence: ſo when you hear that God ſends his Embaſſadors to the world, you
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46564:114"/> muſt know that it is about a great and a weighty buſineſs, about a State buſineſs, it is about that that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the very ſtate of Heaven, the God of Heaven, it is that that concerns God himſelf more neerly than any thing in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s world concerns him, It concerns God next unto his own beeing, and unto his Son, the neereſt of any thing that is without that belongs to a God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are called Embaſſadors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are called Embaſſadors becauſe they muſt look to this; that they do not the leaſt thing but by Commiſſion, it is as much as his life is worth to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Commiſſion in any thing: ſo the miniſters of the Goſpel they muſt keep cloſe to the Commiſſion which they receive from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when he goes to any place, he doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the perſon of the King himſelf from whom he came, and what wrong is done to him is done to the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Let the Embaſſadors be never ſo meane: ſo al the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they come to you in the name of the King of Heaven, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and there is a kind of a repreſentation even of the perſon of Chriſt in them. And that wil appeare more fully when we come to the next point.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, An Embaſſador muſt give an account of his Embaſſage; he muſt (according as there is occaſion) ſend to the country from whence he comes of what buſineſs he hath done: ſo the Miniſters of the Goſpel comming as Embaſſadors, they are ever and anon to ſend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to give an account how they ſpeed in their Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and when they come to declare any meſſage to the people, they are to ſend to Heaven, to tel God whether it be received, or rejected, and it is a very ſad thing to any people, when a miniſter of God ſhal have any Juſt cauſe to ſend up to Heaven his complaint, and ſay, O! Lord, thou haſt ſent me with a bleſſed Embaſſage of peace and reconciliation to this people, but Lord they reject it, they wil rather have their luſts, than al that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46564:114"/> Glory of thine in Jeſus Chriſt; Heaven, and eternal happineſs is a light thing unto them. When a Miniſter makes this complaint, do you not think it wil be a hard thing to thoſe that do reject it? And al faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do this. And if he be a faithful Miniſter, he is ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about his Embaſſage; he looks whether it be entertained, and accordingly he gives notice to heaven, not only weekly, but dayly, how his Embaſſage is entertained, and at the laſt day he muſt give a ful account before the Lord and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, And Laſtly, it is againſt the Law of al nations to abuſe an Embaſſador though he ſhould come upon never ſuch a threatning meſſage, yet you muſt uſe the Embaſſador civily; So it is againſt al laws of religion that can be to abuſe a miniſter of the Goſpel, though he ſhould come with a threatining, But much more when he comes about an Embaſſage of peace; then they are to entertaine him. It is againſt al ſence and reaſon and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al relegion, and thoſe people are moſt prophane, and reprobate to every good work, that ſhal abuſe an Embaſſador comming from Jeſus Chriſt unto them.</p>

                  <p>The Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſent from the greateſt Prince in the world, and ſo they are to be looked upon. Now then if the feet of thoſe that do but bring glad tidings of peace ſhould be beautiful; how much more the feet of the Embaſſador of peace? An Embaſſador, is another manner of thing than one that brings good tidings. O! my bretheren do not give cauſe for any complaint to be made: but rather give you cauſe to thoſe
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46564:115"/> that come amongſt you to ſend up a comfortable account unto God, and to tel God, Lord! thou haſt been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend to ſuch a place; to preach peace to ſuch a people, and Lord! how readily, yea how greedily do thoſe poor ſouls receive this Embaſſage? Lord! never did any Miniſter come into any place where this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage was ſo entertained; Oh! they cry out for peace with thee, and above al things in the world this is the deſire of their ſouls: that they long after is; that they might have peace with their God. Oh! this would be a joyful account, if we could ſend up our account thus unto God, Oh! let not any that come to you as the Embaſſador of Chriſt, be like unto thoſe in <hi>Iſay.</hi> 33.7. The text ſaith, (it is ſpoke of I confeſs in another caſe) but we may apply it here; truly there is cauſe in many Congregations, that the Embaſſador of peace ſhould weep, and that bitterly, the Lord keep you from giving any ſuch occaſion; (though it would be ſad to their hearts) yet it would be more greivous to you. Thus much from the Metaphor.</p>

               <p>For want of the right knowledg of this point it is that there are ſo many ſermons loſt. If people had but this text in their hearts, and looked upon al the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel as if God and Jeſus Chriſt were preſent ſpeaking; how much good would be done? When God doth intend good to any Soul he wil cauſe it to look upon the preaching of the Goſpel, as the very voice of God and Jeſus Chriſt to the Soul. Though many a poor creature that (perhaps) hath heard a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sermons) looked upon preaching as what a man would ſay) but at length when the time of love came, he ſaw an authority, and majeſty of God himſelf, and of Jeſus Chriſt in the Miniſtry, and did feel God ſpeaking to his heart and then it did prevail; that is plain in the text. <hi>As though God did beſeech you by us,</hi> that; that we do, it is as if God did it; and do we pray you? It is in Chriſts ſtead. Now this is not only the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſince Chriſts time: but formerly what was done. Thoſe that were ſent by God to be his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it was as if God and Chriſt did it. You have that proofe of it in the 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> the 3. Chap. 18, 19. verſ. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the ſpirit, by which alſo he went and preached to the ſpirits which are in Priſon.</hi> That is vainly made uſe of by ſome, to prove that Chriſts Soul did deſcend into Hell, to go and preach to the damned in Hell, but certainly that is a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, if you obſerve the text, you ſhal find that this is the meaning of it, obſerve the 20. verſe, It was to thoſe ſpirits which ſomtimes were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God, waited in the daies of <hi>Noah.</hi> Thoſe Spirits that did live in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Noahs</hi> preaching unto them; Now (ſaith the text) they are in priſon, Jeſus Chriſt went &amp; preached to the ſpirits that were diſobedient in the times of <hi>Noah,</hi> that now are in pryſon. How did he go but by his Spirit? by his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46564:116"/> Servant <hi>Noah,</hi> [by <hi>Noah] The preaching of</hi> Noah <hi>was the preaching of Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, There is ſuch a Congregation ſo many a years ago had a faithful Miniſter; Chriſt was preaching ſo many years to thoſe Souls that are now in Priſon: now alas they are gone, they are in Hel: but there was a time that Chriſt was preaching to them. I ſee I muſt not Name many texts. I wil give you one text or two more; in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>You did not receive it as the word of Man;</hi> you looked beyond man: But how did you receive it? from God; and therefore it doth effectually work; that makes the effectual working upon the heart: when the people receive the word as the word of God. And the 4 <hi>Gal.</hi> 14. Mark how the Galatians received the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſaith he there, <hi>And my tentation which was in my fleſh you deſpiſed not, nor rejected: but received me as an Angel of God; even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here he ſpeaks in way of commendation of the Galatians, you receive me as an Angel of God, even as Jeſus Chriſt, as if you had received Chriſt Jeſus; and mark, the Apoſtle was in a poor mean condition in reſpect of his outward eſtate. [My tentation that was in my fleſh] In my outward man I was very low; and this might have been a tentation to you for to have cauſed you to have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me when I ſpake. Oh! this hath been a tentation to many men becauſe the preacher is an Earthen Veſſel, though he hath brought the right treaſure of the Goſpel, yet this hath been a tentation. But ſaith he, it was not ſo with you, you received me; though poor, weak, a mean man that had ſcarce bread to eate: yet you received me as an Angel of God, yea beyond that: as Chriſt Jeſus himſelf. But yet you ſhal obſerve in the next words, that it ſeems their hearts began to be drawn aſide; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the 15. verſ. There was a time when I came firſt amongſt you, when you wer ready to have pluct out your very eyes for me, and you cryed out; O! this bleſſed doctrine of the goſpel that we now hear! but where is the bleſſedneſs? It ſeems that ſome falſ teachers had come,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46564:116"/> and inveigled them, and had taken them off from the Apoſtle. Oh! Where is the bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? as if that were now gone: but that is the Duty of people, and then, and only then it is like that the Miniſtry of the word can do any great good: When, the people look upon it as if God ſpake, and Jeſus Chriſt ſpake unto them. I wil only conclude with this one thing; that til you do come to apprehend this, it is not like that ever any great good, to any purpoſe wil be done; Its like it wil be with you, as it was with <hi>Samuel;</hi> you know God called to <hi>Samuel; Samuel, Samuel</hi> ſaith God, he runs to <hi>Ely;</hi> ſaith he, my Son, I did not cal thee, wel, he went again and ſlept and God calls again; He did not know it was Gods voice; he runs to <hi>Ely</hi> again: but then the text faith, that <hi>Ely</hi> perceived that God called the Child, &amp; <hi>Ely</hi> gave him this inſtruction that if he called again, he ſhould ſay, Lord ſpeak, for thy ſervant heareth. And then he went and ſlept again, and the Lord came, and called to him, and then he ſaid, <hi>ſpeak Lord thy Servant heareth:</hi> And then God opened his heart unto him. Oh! God called the firſt time, and he thought it had been <hi>Ely,</hi> and looked no further. God ſaid no more to him but left him, and ſo again, the ſecond time: But when he came to underſtand that it was Gods voice, then you ſhal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; that God opened himſelf wonderfully to him, and ſhewed him [then] his minde to the ful. So juſt thus it is with people, they come [now] to hear the Miniſtry of the word; they hear a ſound in their ears, and what they hear is very good: but they look only at a man; the man ſpeak, and they may perhaps commend the man, and commend his Sermon, &amp; al this whil God ſpeaks not to their hearts. And then they wil go the ſecond time, and it is true, God doth ſpeak to them: but they do not know it is Gods Voice, and becauſe they do not know it is Gods voice, God doth not make known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them: But when the time of Gods Love comes, this is the great Embaſſage that is ſent to the Children of men, And when he pleads with you, you ſhould think
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46564:117"/> that it is Chriſt that is pleading with you; when he is opening of any Scripturre to you, you ſhould think that it is Chriſt that is pleading with you; when he is opening of any ſcripture to you, you ſhould think that Jeſus Chriſt is opening that Scripture to you, and when you com with ſuch a heart, then God opens al his mind to you. I appeal to you whether it hath not been juſt thus; the dealings of God with you as it it was with <hi>Samuel;</hi> you have come once and again to a ſermon, but have looked no further then <hi>Ely;</hi> to the miniſter: but when you have come to the word with the diſpoſition, <hi>and ſaid Lord ſpeake for thy ſervant hears, Lord</hi> reveal what thou wilt; I ſe it is thine one ordinance, and the miniſter, (though he be but a poor weak man) yet he comes and ſtands in thy ſtead, and ſpeaks in thy name, and I ſay, when you come thus you ſhal find more in one ſermon let out to you, then in a thouſand before, and here is the ground that many have lived thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years under a powerful miniſtry and it hath ſounded in their eares, but they never have heard the mind of God ſavingly revealed unto them. Becauſe they never have fallen down, and ſaid, <hi>lord speak for thy ſervant hears</hi> O! do this, and thou ſhalt hear the great meſſuage from God: then you ſhal have God oppening himſelfe unto you to the ful.</p>

               <p>I Have made ſome enterance into this ſecond point. Doct. <hi>That God and Chriſt doth speake in the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of his word.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46564:117"/> as if God and Chriſt did it. This is Cleere in the text. As though God did beſeech you, we pray you in Chriſts ſteed (ſaith the Apoſtle).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this I gave you divers ſcriptures; &amp; I might ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, ct thought to have added ſome more cleer ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſhew you that what the miniſters do, it is as if God &amp; Chriſt did it, I might name forty places that are cleer in this point but ſhal not that I may proceed. What the miniſter; of God ſpeak according to the ruls (I ſay) it is as if God and Chriſt ſpake, and it muſt needs be ſure, if we conſider of the power that there is of Chriſt in the miniſtry: we have had experience of it, that there is ſuch a power of the miniſtry of the word that it co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld not be but only by the ſpeaking of God, God and Chriſt in It: the which hath power to inlighten, to awaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to terrefie the conſcience, to humble, to bring down the ſtouteſt proud heart in the world, yea, and to convert ſouls, in <hi>John.</hi> 5.25. the text ſaith of the word of the ſon of God that brings life, <hi>Verily</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, that the houre is comming, and now is when the dead ſhal hear the voice of the ſon of God and they that hear ſhal live.</hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> certainly this is ſpoken not only of the voice of the ſon of God at the general reſurrection, but (ſaith he) it is now; the hower is comming, and now is when the dead ſhal hear the voice of the ſon of God and they that hear ſhal live. It was at the time, and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the miniſtry of the word; There is the voice of the ſon of God that makes the dead to hear and to live.</p>
               <p>And further the word of the Miniſtery, muſt be looked upon as Gods in this regard; becauſe otherwiſe there could not be any ground or bottom for faith by any thing that is delivered in the Miniſtery of the word. Now we know that the miniſtery of the word is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ordinance that is appointed for the begetting of faith. <hi>faith comes by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word preached.</hi> It doth not come ſo much by reading; no, not by reading of the book of God; by reading of the ſcripture: but by
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46564:118"/> hearing, and hearing the word preached. Now then you wil ſay, indeed, The word in the Bible, that is the word of God; God ſpeaks there, and Chriſt ſpeaks, and we may bottom our faith upon what we read there, but we muſt have ſomthing to bottom our faith upon when we hear it preacht by man, as wel as when we read it, and it is cleer by ſcripture; that God doth rather work by the hearing of it preacht, than by the reading of it. Except we look upon it as the word of God and Chriſt, we have nothing to bottom our Faith upon, (for nothing that is humane can be the bottom, and ground of any ones faith.) It is not, what is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a man, though he be never ſo learned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo holy a man) that can bottom or ground my faith. But when I come to heare him, (ſo as I can heare God, and Chriſt ſpeaking in him) then have I ſomthing, to ground my faith upon what he ſaith, therefore, here is the reaſon why ſo many go away, and are only taken at the preſent hearing, but their hearts are not grounded, and bottomed in the truth, becauſe they hear man only, and do not heare God: But when people can ſay as thoſe men that came forth from Samaria to the woman, in <hi>John</hi> 4. about the middle of the Chap. ſayd, that when the woman came and told them; <hi>Here is a man that hath tould me al that ever I did; is not he Chyiſt?</hi> And they went out to him: But at length ſay they to her, (when they had ſpoken to him) <hi>Now we do beleeve; (not becauſe thou haſt told us, but becauſe we have heard him our ſelves.)</hi> So may many a ſoul ſay, I have been often hearing of ſermons, and I have been taken with the preaching of ſuch a man, and I did beleeve what he ſaid, and it went into my heart in ſome meaſure: Oh! but now ſaith a ſoul, I do not beleeve becauſe he tells me this, but I have heard in his preaching, God and Chriſt himſelf, it hath not been he; but it hath been Jeſus Chriſt that hath ſpoken to my heart. There could be no grounding of our faith (except that which is delivered
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46564:118"/> in the Miniſtery of the word) be looked upon as God and Chriſt ſpeaking in them.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>You wil ſay, muſt we bleeve every thing that the Preacher ſpeaks, as if God and Chriſt ſpake it? men may err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore you muſt compare what you hear with what you read, and as thoſe noble men of <hi>Berea</hi> did ſearch the Scripture to ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf preacht; they were not to take <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, but to compare it with other Scriptures, and they were commended for it, and God forbid that we ſhould think it much that people ſhould examine any thing we ſpeak. <hi>Try all things, and then keep that which is good;</hi> ſearch the Scriptures, and compare what is delivered by Scripture, and then ſo far as that is according to the rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ſpoken, (though it be not directly the words of the Scripture, yet when it is ſpoken in the name of God according to Scripture) it ſhould be received as if God and Chriſt ſpoke it. We challenge no ſuch infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility as the Papiſts ſay the Pope hath: but we give unto al people liberty to examine our Doctrine by Scripture, and then God expects, and Chriſt expects that it ſhould be received as if God and Chriſt ſpake.</p>

                  <p>NOW then briefly, Hence we have a Uſe of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where we have an anſwer to the Objection both of the Arminians, &amp; of our late Wantons; Arminians they make this Objection; when we preach (ſomtimes) that al men naturally are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and there is no free wil in man, but man is as void of Grace
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46564:119"/> as the dead Carkaſs that lies in the grave is void of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life; Now they ſay, If men be ſo dead in ſins, Why do you preach to them? Were it not a vain thing to go and preach in the Church-yard? Would they regard what you ſay? you preach that al are dead, and that there is no life at al in men to do any good, Why do you ſpeak to them? This point anſwers that Objection.</p>
                  <p>Though it is a truth that al men naturally are dead in ſins, and are before the Lord as a dead Carrion; there is no dead Carrion more loathſome in the eyes of us, than every natural Soul is in the Eyes of God: but yet we come and preach to them. Why? becauſe that in our preaching, it is God; God and Chriſt ſpeaks, though our voice have no power to raiſe from the dead: yet the voice of God hath power to raiſe from the dead. If Chriſt wil ſpeak to one that is dead, he ſhal come forth; as you know in the 11. of <hi>John.</hi> when Chriſt came to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſay to thee</hi> Lazarus <hi>ariſe.</hi> It were a vain thing for any of us to go to the grave, and ſay, ariſe; but if Chriſt come he can raiſe them preſently: So we preach to a congregation that are mixt; ſome that have lain in the grave of ſin forty years perhaps together, yet when we ſpeak in the name of Chriſt, and Chriſt ſpeaks together with us, we may ſpeak to dead Souls: for together with the word that is ſpoken there doth go a power and a life, for it is the word of God (and not the word of man) that breaths forth life.</p>
                  <p>And again, it is an anſwer to the Objection of our late Wantons, they cry out againſt Miniſters calling to men for duties, and account them duty-mongers: Say they, What do you cal to men to do? you tel them that they muſt do thus, and thus, and they muſt perform duties, and humble themſelves. They think they have got a great Objection in this; that becauſe men have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer naturally: therefore it is a vain thing to cal upon them to perform duties</p>
                  <p>This anſwers them; We cal upon them, ſo as the voice
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46564:119"/> of Chriſt; though they have no power themſelves, yet we cal upon them to ſet upon ſuch duties; we cal upon them to beleeve, and to repent. They ſay it is in vain to cal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to beleeve, and repent: But that way that God hath to work Faith, &amp; Repentance in the heart of man; it is, to conveigh a power through his own voice in the miniſtry of his word; and therefore we ſpeak to them to beleeve &amp; repent, as if they had power: becauſe we know that thoſe which belong unto Gods election, the Lord wil conveigh power to them through this word of his. It is not our voice, but it is the voice of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt. We would have you to carry this meditation along with you, at any time when we ſpeak unto you, and exhort you that you would come in, &amp; repent, and beleeve; Carry this meditation with you, and then you ſhal underſtand us aright. We would not have you to think, that we conceive, you have power to beleeve, and repent becauſe we cal upon you: but this we expect; that, while we are ſpeaking to you that God &amp; Chriſt wil ſpeak to your hearts: ſo that there wil be power conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through that word of ours, and though it be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed this Sermon, yet it may be the next, or the next, and hoping in the end that wil give repentance unto life.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe. 2.</hi> Miniſters ought to ſpeak as the Oracles of God. The maner of their preaching Opened.</head>
                  <p>THe next uſe that ariſes from hence is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> makes in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. If any man ſpeak, <hi>let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God,</hi> mark it, here is an exhortation to thoſe that have to deal in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word, that they muſt (when they ſpeak the word) ſpeak it as the Oracles of God; ſo that, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46564:120"/> is delivered in the word; you ſee it to be as the Oracles of God, whatſoever a miniſter ſpeaks (according to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) it is to be looked upon as the oracles of God. Now therefore if this be ſo, that the word that is ſpoken (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule,) is the Oracles of God. then it is the duty of al that do ſpeak the word of God to ſpeak it in ſuch a manner, as it may appear to be the Oracles of God. I have not now to ſpeak to many miniſters, and therfore I ſhal not enlarge my ſelf in this as I ſhould have done. Oh! with what a reverance ſhould miniſters ſpeak, for they come to ſpeak as in Chriſt ſtead? and therefore they ſhould ſpeak in ſuch a manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the voice of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt; as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, and not think to ſpeak according to their own fancies, and their own humors, and in their own waies: but to ſpeak as thoſe that are ſent in Gods place, to ſpeak to the people as if Chriſt were ſpeaking to them: and therefore to conſider they are in the place of Chriſt, ſo to ſpeak with all authority as from Chriſt, as in <hi>Math.</hi> 7. verſe, the laſt, It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he taught them as one having authority, and not as the ſcribes;</hi> for a miniſter of God, he is to preach in Chriſts ſtead (for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith) therefore he is to labor what he can to expreſs the very authority of Jeſus Chriſt in his Miniſtery, and there is a miniſtery that doth carry authority with it in the very conſciences of men, I have known of ſome that have come proudly into a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſcorne at the word; Prophane Ruſſians that have come on purpoſe to outface the Miniſtery, and to out face the word, and yet they have met with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the word, that their hearts have been danted, and they have fallen under the power of the word, and there is a great deal of difference in the manner and way of preaching the word; ſome have authority, and others have no authority at al in it. [That kind of preaching that is to pleaſe the humors of men] you, ſhal have ſome kind of preachers to dandle mens fancies (as it were;) that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46564:120"/> have ſome fine quaint words, that there ſentences ſhal be very ſmooth, and (as they ſay) come off bravely, and this is a dainty preacher, and he ſhal have many fine latine ſentences, and witty ſpeeches, and come into a pulpit and acts as if he were to act a part upon the ſtage: theſe are the fine quaint preachers, the Court preachers (as they cal them) But this is not to preach as in Chriſts ſtead. It is very like that this was the preaching of the Scribes and Phariſes. But when Chriſt: came to ſpeak, he ſpake as one that God had authority, and not as the Scribes: There was a great deal of difference between his preaching, and that of the Scribes, he came with the authority of God, he came to preach to the conſciences of men, and not to the fancies of men; and the difference, as there was in him, ſo there is in ſome meaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree now; <hi>There are ſome that preach (to this very day) juſt as the ſcribes; but there are others that preach as Chriſt did; that preacht to the conſcience, and to the hearts of people,</hi> and their words do ſtick in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, though they fret, and vex, and go away in a rage; yet there is ſomwhat that ſticks to their conſciences: ſo that they are either forced to yeild to it, or fly from it. And here is the reaſon that many a man wil cry out and ſay, I wil never heare ſuch a miniſter, Why? What is the reaſon? his corrupt heart cannot bear that miniſters preaching; the word comes with power to his heart, and his guilty conſcience cannot beare it, now watch but whether there be not ſome vile guiltineſs in their ſpirits, that ſay of ſuch men, they wil never hear them any more: becauſe their corrupt hearts cannot bear the authority of the word, <hi>that preaching that is as if God and Chriſt ſpeak it, is with authority, and not with fine quaint words:</hi> To this purpoſe you have an expreſſion in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. [for Chriſt ſent me] he was to go in the name of Chriſt, <hi>[not with wiſdom of men]</hi> Chriſt did never ſend me to preach with the wiſdom of men. What a text is here? How wil many men be able to anſwer this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46564:121"/> one text? that make it their great ſtudy to get Wiſdom of words? But mark the danger of this! <hi>[Leaſt the Croſs] of Chriſt be made of no effect.</hi> There is a moſt hiddeous wickedneſs in this; that a man ſhould regard more to be commended for a fine, Witty, neat, ſmooth preacher, than he ſhould have regard to the Croſs of Chriſt to take effect, to have Chriſt to be honor'd. We find by experience that ſuch preaching ſcarce ever ſtirs the Soul, ſeldome or never works upon the heart. It was a ſpeech that once even a Prelate that was not the beſt, but one ill enough, and known to many (I ſuppoſe here,) I heard it with my own Ears, he ſaid, <hi>That he was convinced ſo farr; that when he came to preſent one to ſuch a town, he asked whether there were not ſome in the place that deſired ſome others? Yes ſaid they, there are ſome that deſire a univerſity man to come to them, but ſaith he, the preaching that is there wil not humble a Soul, doth not tend to humiliation.</hi> I heard this even from one that I know was not a freind to powerful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and yet his conſcience was ſo farr convinced from it; becauſe the wiſdom of words and learning is there ſhewed: but that kind of way of preaching the Goſpel, it makes the Croſſe of Chriſt to be of no effect. Your flaunting preachers, when do they convert a Soul? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith the Apoſtle) if we preach ſo as to do good, it muſt be ſuch a preaching as is in the 18. verſ. <hi>It muſt be fooliſhneſs to (wicked) men, but to theſe that are ſaved it is the power of God, and the Wiſdom of God.</hi> wicked carnal men wil ſay, here is no Schollerſhip, no learning in ſuch a Sermon, Wel, it is fooliſhneſs to them, but to them that are ſaved, it is the power of God to Salvation. but ſuch a poor man ſayth, I know not what they ſay, But I find a power in it, my Eyes were never awakened til now, my heart was never wrought upon til now; to thoſe that are ſaved it is the power of God. If you find a power in it, that which wicked men cal fooliſhneſs; it is a good argument that you are one that ſhal be ſaved
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46564:121"/> when it quickens you. And again in the 19. <hi>verſ. For it is written, I wil deſtroy the Wiſdom of the wiſe, and wil bring to nothing the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> Al their bravery ſhal come to nothing, and then in the 23. <hi>verſ. But we preach Chriſt Crucified, unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> And then again the 2. Chap. verſ. 1. <hi>And I Brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, or of (mans) wiſdom.</hi> You wil ſay, it was becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> could not; No, <hi>Paul</hi> was an admirable Scholler, a moſt Eloquent man, he was brought up under the feet of Gamaliel; And yet this man came not with excellency of ſpeech, or Wiſdom of words declaring to them the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of God, for ſaith he in the 2. verſ. I <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to know any thing amongſt you ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, &amp;c.</hi> This makes the word powerful; when it comes in the evidence and demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit, and not with entiſing words of mans Wiſdom, that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of man, but in the power of God: howbeit we ſpeak Wiſdom amongſt thoſe that are perfect; There is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in preaching.</p>
                  <p>You wil ſay, why? ſhould preachers be fool?</p>
                  <p>No, God forbid, there ſhould be the greateſt Wiſdom that can be, and this is no warrant for one to come into the Pulpet, and to ſpeak extempore, we do not come to juſtifie a raw and empty diſcourſe, that hath nothing in it but meer words, and a noiſe, but hath no ſolildity; No, let Miniſters ſtudy, and Labor to be as ſollid as they can, &amp; ſearch into the miſteries of the Goſpel, &amp; open the ſecrets of God, &amp; ſo it wil prevail with the conſciences of men, &amp; if Miniſters have any parts, there is matter enough to expreſs the parts of thoſe that are moſt able, and that which requires their ſtudy; and ſo the Apoſtle would have <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſtudy, and therefore it is no juſtifying of thoſe that do not ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt remember we come to ſpeak in Chriſts ſteed; Chriſt certainly did not come with empty words,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46564:122"/> but he came to open the counſels of his Father, and he did reveal the, great Miſteries of the Goſpel, it was in a ſollid way, &amp; ſo the Apoſtle, that which they ſpake was weighty and ſollid (though it was not with vain words and phraſes as I ſpake before.) But this I name the rather, (not that I direct my ſpeech ſo much to Miniſters as to you people; ſeeing you hear that this is our point; that God &amp; Chriſt ſpeaks in the Miniſtry of the word, that therefore you ſhould deſire, and affect ſuch a kind of Miniſtry wherein God ſpeaks moſt, wherein Chriſt ſpeaks moſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you can hear the voice of God, and of Chriſt, And I know no one argument that doth more fully evidence the difference between a carnal heart, and a gratious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual heart than this. What Miniſtry doth thy heart moſt ſavour, and relliſh? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hereby you may know the temper of your hearts, <hi>One may know the temper of the body by knowing what food one doth moſt ſavour: ſo we may know the temper of the heart, by knowing what food it doth moſt relliſh; if thou doſt relliſh frothy food thy heart is according to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if thou doſt relliſh and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a ſpiritual Miniſtry that comes in the power and authority of God and Chriſt, that ſpeaks to thy heart and conſcience; this is an evidence, and ſign of a gracious diſpoſition in thy heart.</hi> And the truth is, in one that is fallen (or in a great meaſure) from God; if there be any ſparks of grace remayning, they wil appear in this as much as in any thing; that though his heart be grown more looſe than it was: yet ſtil he cannot but acknowledg he doth find more power in ſuch a ſpiritual Miniſtry than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But your carnal hearts they wil ſavour and reliſh of a Miniſtry, that is a meer word miniſtry, that hath leaſt of God and Chriſt; where there is but little of God and Chriſt in the heart, there the Miniſtry that hath leaſt of God and Chriſt is moſt relliſhed. Some Women, and ſome that are ignorant; if they hear a Sermon that hath a great deal of Greek, &amp; latin in it that they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; they go away and commend his Sermon though
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46564:122"/> they underſtand not any one thing of it. I have heard of an excellent ſtory of a poor begger (in Queen <hi>Blizabeths</hi> time) who heard a Sermon at the Court, and heard a great many Latine Sentences, and Eloquent ſpeeches, and the poor beggar, he follows the Miniſter when he was going away, and bleſſes God, and ſays, Oh! Maſter Doctor; I bleſs God, and thank God at my heart. The Miniſter turns about and asks him, what the matter is? Oh! Maſter Doctor ſaies he, I hope the old Religion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in again.</p>
                  <p>But have not the Prelates Silenced thoſe men that wrought moſt upon the heart, and conſcience?

Chriſt would not preach to defend ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious vanities; for Chriſt (when he came to preach) preached ſo, as the people many times derided him, and ſcorned him: One time when he had done his Sermon they carryed him to the brow of the hil of the City, and would preſently have broken his Neck. Do but read that Sermon of Chriſt in the 5, 6, 7. <hi>Math.</hi> What
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46564:123"/> preachers would you think your Courtiers to be if Chriſt were preaching to you? that, that comes neareſt to that; that Chriſt would preach, that you muſt moſt favor, and affect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That kind of preaching you think in your conſciences doth moſt prevaile in the authority of the word, hath humbled moſt hearts, and converted moſt ſouls, that Chriſt hath ſet his ſeal unto. I appeal unto you, what kind of preaching hath humbled moſt ſouls, and done moſt good? Hath not ſome poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try preacher, that hath preached in the evidence, and demonſtration of the ſpirit, converted more ſouls unto God than an hundered Biſhops? ſo that he may be able to ſay, at the great day of judgment (according to his meaſure) as our bleſſed Savior ſaid, Here am I, and thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Examine of what ſide you be; thoſe that be of Gods ſide, they know his voice; (my ſheep hear my voice) but a ſtranger they wil not follow, take any town, and divide the people, and ſee how the Miniſter is liked, ſome are for, and ſome againſt him. But now look into the difference of their lives; of both theſe kinds of men of thoſe that are for, and thoſe that are againſt the Miniſter; ſee their different walkings; come into ſuch a place as this, (Becauſe they ſay there is a thouſand ale-houſes belonging to this place, of Stepny; I think there be hardly five that do ſavor the Miniſtery of the word, and al your prophane ones (generally) they ſpeak againſt the Miniſters. Now I appeal to your conſciences, (if you were to ſtand before God at the day of judgment) of which ſide would you be? either of the ſide of thoſe that are drunkards, ſwearers, uncleane perſons, and raylers at the Miniſtery of the word: or of the ſide of thoſe that are willing to take paines to heare the word of God, and bleſs God for the Miniſtery of his word. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that preaching hath moſt of Chriſt in it that thoſe that have moſt of the Spirit of Chriſt do moſt ſavour; fot they know the voice of Chriſt, and a ſtranger they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46564:123"/> wil not hear; they can underſtand it, though wicked and ungodly ones cannot. That is the Second uſe.</p>

                  <p>A Third Uſe of the point is this; Is the miniſtry of the word ſuch, as hath God and Chriſt ſpeaking in it? Oh then! How ſhould we delight in it? How ſhould we bleſs God for it? With what greedineſs ſhould we come to hear at any time? What? is not the voice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſweet unto us?

[If you be Godly, Chriſt doth delight in your voice] when you are gotten alone in your Cloſets, and can ſpeak but brokenly, O then! your voice is delightful to him: Therefore the voice of Chriſt ſhould be very delightful unto you. I wil give you a Text or two for proof of this; <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. It is a ſpeech of Chriſt to the Church; <hi>O my dove! that are in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs: let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comly.</hi> O! let me hear thy voice my dove; O! thou that art in the ſecret places of the ſtairs; Art thou got alone into a hole to prayer? got alone behind the dore in the ſecret places? (for it is ſpoken here of the eſtate of the Church in times of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that they dare not come together openly, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wicked men wil raile at them, and ſay, they get into corners to do thus and thus) but ſaith Chriſt, thou that art in the clefts of the rocks; in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, let me hear thy voice; for thy voice is ſweet,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46564:124"/> and thy countenance is comely.

Now what an argument is this? Shal thy lips be ſo ſweet to Chriſt, and ſhal not Chriſts lips be as ſweet to thee? the Miniſtry of the word is as if Chriſt did entreat thee, and beſeech thee; O! how ſweet ſhould it be to thee if thou haſt the Spirit of Chriſt? the Church of Chriſt doth anſwer what Chriſt ſaid of her lips, and of her Voice, and of her Mouth: ſo the Church doth anſwer to Chriſt in the 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> mark what the Church ſaith of his Mouth, what an Eccho is here, and an anſwer to prayer? ſaith Chriſt to the Church, <hi>Thy lips (O my Spouſe) are as the hony-comb: And thy mouth</hi> (O <hi>my Saviour) is moſt ſweet.</hi> In <hi>John.</hi> 3.29. he ſaith there, <hi>That the friend of the Bridegroom which ſtands, and hears the Bridegroomes voice, rejoiceth greatly.</hi> If thou be the ſpouſe of Chriſt, thou wilt rejoice to hear the voice of the Brdegroom, and every time thou comeſt to hear a conſcionable Sermon, thou do'ſt come to hear the very Voyce of the Bridegroom, and thou canſt not but rejoyce in it, O! how ſweet is one word of Chriſt to a gracious heart? and the ſpiritual communion with Chriſt here upon earth; it is in his ordinances; we ſhal hereafter be alwaies in his preſence, and ſee his face: But if he would have any evidence that we ſhal have communion with him in heaven, we muſt Rejoyce in the hearing of his word.</p>

                  <p>Now a word or two to thoſe that diſobey the word; they wil ſet their judgments againſt the judgments of the miniſters, &amp; let him ſay what he wil, it is but his opinion. Do you know what you ſay? this rebellion is againſt God &amp; againſt Chriſt: as if there were this language in your hearts; Chriſt ſaith, I wil have this done; thy luſts ſay they wil have this done: O! this wil be charged upon thee one day; that the voice of the divel was more ſtrong with thee than the voice of Chriſt: but ſpecially it is to contemne the word, to ſet at naught Gods councels; to go away &amp; contemn the word. Doſt thou know what thou doſt? let me apply but theſe two ſcriptures to thee, thou that Deſpiſeſt and Scorneſt the word, that canſt go to company, and there talke of what thou doſt heare in a contemnning manner; conſider but of theſe two
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46564:125"/> texts; I pray, firſt Conſider of the text out of which the Point is Raiſed of Gods Speaking to thee, thou doſt deſpiſe, and doſt thou ſo? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the text in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.23. Saith, <hi>when thou getteſt into company, and there art warme with wine, Oh! then thou lifteſt up the voice, and laugheſt;</hi> againſt whom haſt thou lift up thy voice? thou thinkeſt it is againſt <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> No, it is againſt the Holy one of Iſrael; thou thinkeſt it is againſt ſuch a man that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a day; no, it is againſt the Holy God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and this is upon thy ſcore written in Heaven; here is one that hath reproached the Holy one, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, In <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me, &amp;c.</hi> That is true (not only of the deſciples, that were there for the preſent upon the earth) but of al the faithful miniſters to the end of the world, for Chriſt ſaith, when he ſends them out, <hi>I wil be with you to the end of the world.</hi> They were dead more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years agoe, and Chriſt yet had promiſed to be with them, that is, thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them; he would be with them to the end of the world. And this Text concerns every faithful miniſter as wel as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt; al that time you deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt, and God his Father, when you deſpiſe the miniſtery of his word; for the Lords ſake take heed what you do; when you have to deal with the word, you have to deal with an edge tool; it is that, that wil either ſave you, or deſtroy you for ever. You that have been guilty of neglecting the word, the Lord ſtrike and humble your hearts, and for a Cordial for time to come I wil apply but one ſcripture further to you, and that is that, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. What is that? that in the faithful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word, God and Chriſt ſpeaks unto people. Then take this exhortation; <hi>So that yee refuſe not him that ſpeaketh. If they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpak on Earth, much more ſhal not we eſcape if we turne away him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> The Miniſtery of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46564:126"/> and the Miniſtery of the Law are compared, One ſpeaking from Earth, the other from Heaven; though the truth is, they were both from Heaven. But now in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, God hath ſent his own Son to you. <hi>In the latter daies, he hath ſpoken by his Son</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in 1. <hi>Heb. the begining; God who at ſundery times ſpak in times paſt to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt times ſpoken to us by his Son &amp;c.</hi> In former times God ſpake by his Prophets; there was the voice of God (but it is not ſo cleer that there was the voice of God, though it is true Chriſt did ſpeak then by the prophets) but in compariſon Chriſt is not ſaid to ſpeak by them) But now in theſe daies, God hath ſpoken by his Son, and God hath reſerved the Miniſtery of his Grace, and his eternal counſels concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Children of men; God hath reſerved this for his Son; and not only his Son perſonally, but his Son in the Miniſtery of his word. Now you wil ſay, If Chriſt did preach (as you ſay he doth) there would be more power. We find that when Chriſt did preach that the Phariſes derided him; in the original it is; they blew their noſes at him, and marke! they that were covetous they derided him, they even derided Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. A worldly heart that is growen rich; that hath gotten from a low eſtate to a far greater; he wil deride the moſt excellent preaching in the world. Take heed that you do not deſpiſe the Miniſtery, for certainly the voice of Chriſt wil prevaile one day. If it doth not prevaile here in the word; it ſhal prevail one day when Chriſt ſhal ſay depart from me yee curſed; though thou doſt not obey the preſent voice of Chriſt, yet thou ſhalt obey the other voice at that day. I muſt wind up this point with a word of Exhortation.</p>

                  <p>SEEing God and Chriſt doth ſpeak to us in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word: Let us come with other manner of thoughts to hear the word, than hertofore we have done. I remember I ſpake before that the word cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual til we come to know the voice of Chriſt in it; as in that of <hi>Samuel;</hi> I wil give you another text to ſhew what an admirable effect it wil work upon the hearts of men, and women; if they come to hear the preachings of the word as the voice of God and Chriſt: and that is in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. You ſhal find there; that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had ſent for <hi>Peter</hi> to come to him imediately: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> I <hi>ſent to thee, and thou haſt wel done that thou art come; Now therefore are we al here preſent before God to hear althings that are commanded thee of God.</hi> Here is a gracious diſpoſition of heart in <hi>Cornelius</hi> a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and other Souldiers, and friends that he had. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently when <hi>Peter</hi> came, now ſaith he are we here al preſent before God, to hear al things that are commanded thee of God, and we al here entertaine whatſoever thou ſhalt reveal to us from God, as the word of God: then <hi>Peter</hi> (indeed) preached with a courage, and when people ſhal (by their behavior) with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and affection attend, as if they did attend to know ſomething of the mind of God; this encourages a preacher, and then aſſoon as ever <hi>Peter</hi> had done his Sermon, nay before he had done his Sermon; (the text ſaith) in <hi>verſe,</hi> 44. <hi>That while</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpake theſe words, the holy ſpirit fel upon al them which heard the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46564:127"/> word:</hi> No marvil, they came with ſuch a diſpoſition of heart. We are here al of us to know, and heare what is commanded of God; (comming with ſuch a frame of ſpirit.) Now, while <hi>Peter</hi> was yet ſpeaking, the holy ſpirit fel on them which were to heare the word, and ſo it wil be with you; when you are alone before you come, ſay, Oh Lord! that thou wouldeſt ſpeak to my heart, even ſo as you have it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. <hi>Come let us go up to the houſe of the Lord.</hi> An excellent ſpeech for thoſe that are comming to hear, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2. There is a propheſie of the times of the Goſpel, there is an excellent reſolution, an excellent temper of heart for people that are going to hear ſermons; come ye let us go up to the mountaine of the Lord; to the houſe of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he wil teach us of his waies, and we wil walk in his paths. [We are al here to hear what God wil ſay to us;] when at any time there is any truth made known to you, you ſhould receive it with ſuch an affection. God this day hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſome part of his mind that I did not find to be ſo before, and when you hear of any ſin revealed; you ſhould bleſs God, and ſay, the Lord hath met with my heart this day; Oh! think it not an evil, but bleſs God that Chriſt wil think of thee: And ſo thou ſhouldeſt behave thy ſelfe. Is there an exhortation to any duty? God and Jeſus Chriſt hath exhorted thee this day; thou ſhouldeſt look upon it as if God and Chriſt hath been a perſwading and exhorting thee; and is there any word of comfort and promiſe applied unto thee? thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt look upon it as if God, and Jeſus Chriſt had ſpoken a word of comfort to thy heart this day. Oh! if you would come with ſuch a diſpoſition as to receive al from God, and Jeſus Chriſt, then you may expect that the Holy Spirit ſhould fal upon you. No marvail though when people come through cuſtom, and meerly becauſe others come; or through ſome other vaine reſpect: that then they come, and go away, and never feel any work of the Holy Spirit. But ſuch as come with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46564:127"/> teachable hearts, they may expect that the holy Spirit ſhould come and fal upon them. When the very people of <hi>Niniveh</hi> did repent, they beleeved God, ſo then the ſtouteſt and proudeſt heart; yea and the hardeſt heart in the world, if it comes to beleeve God, then it wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. I am the willinger to be the more large in this, becauſe this Sermon may make profitable many other Sermons, and for want of that true work of this point upon your hearts, it is that ſo many Sermons do ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the conſideration of the excellency of the Goſpel that is committed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of it to preach, makes them that are faithful to be very earneſt in their Miniſtration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now unto us is committed the word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Emboſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt ſtead &amp;c.

               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:46564:128"/>
               <p>Firſt, that the conſideration of the excellency of the Goſpel that is committed to the Miniſters of it, is that that ſhould make them earneſt in their miniſtration, and to labor with al their might to draw people to that love of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The ſame that you have heard in this Chapter, you have it again in the beginning of the next Chapter. The Apoſtle having the word again and again; that it is the Miniſtry of Reconciliation that is committed to them. After that he tels them, that he beſeeches, and prayes in Chriſts ſtead &amp; then he comes over it again in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next Chapter, as if he had not done enough. O this Miniſtry of Reconciliation! it is the Garce of God unto people; O we beſeech you ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Do not recive this Grace of God in vain,</hi> the Apoſtles, &amp; ſo other faithful Miniſters ſatisfie not themſelves meerly in performing a task (yet they can come &amp; ſpeak an hour, and ſpeak to people ſuch things as may pleaſe their Ears) but they look after what they do to be ſolicitous, and earneſt for fear it ſhould be in vain. O! then we as Embaſſadors &amp;c. And I wil ſhew you another Text that is very remarkable, in the 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 25. <hi>I am made a Miniſter, according to the diſpenſation of God which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of God,</hi> and then he fals a commending of this Miniſtry of his in the Myſtery that hath bin hid from ages, and from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but now is made manifeſt to the Saints. It may be carnal hearts look upon it as a mad and unſavory thing: But it is made manifeſt to the Saints; to whom God would make known, what is the riches of the glory of this Myſtery amongſt the Gentiles. Now then mark how our point comes in, in the 28. ver. the Apoſtle would fain gain every man; he is loth to loſe any one of his Auditors; every man, every man, every man, three times in one verſe, <hi>Whereunto alſo I labor ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me mightily.</hi> What Phraſes are here heapt one upon another? I do not
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:46564:128"/> make the work of the miniſtry an idle work; as if I went about al the day from one company to another; from Tavern, to Tavern al the week, and then think to come and preach upon the Lords day to you, and ſo make it an idle buſineſs: but it is my labor, and not only ſo, but I ſtrive, and how doth he ſtrive? (not meerly according to humane ſtrength, he ſtrives beyond that) I labor ſtriving according to his working; It is the word of God I confeſs, and my labor, and ſtriving, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his working. Yet ſtil this is not enough, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his working which worketh in me, Which worketh in me mightily.

O! this is the truſt that is committed unto us; we are allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel; even ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God, we are upright in that we dare not be but faithful in ſo great a truſt which is committed to us, and then upon this he tels them in verſe 8. we were willing to impart our own ſouls; becauſe this Goſpel, we knew it would be to excellent.

               <p>FOr the Firſt, The willingneſs of God for Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with ſinners; Why God manifeſts this, To begin a little low, and then to riſe higher; God mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters this, firſt by his patience towards ſinners, in that the Lord is long ſuffering toward ſinners, he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt thereby that he is willing to be reconciled: the Scripture draws an argument from thence, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, the patience of God holds this forth unto you; that you ſhould come in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that ſo you might obtain mercy from God, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it doth lead you to repentance. Except it ſhould hold forth Gods willingneſs to be reconciled, it could not draw the heart to repentance; but it leads: and this hath a great deal of force to draw the heart of man to repentance, Becauſe it holds forth the willingneſs of God to be reconciled unto ſinners. If God were not willing to be reconciled to you, he would take you off, and there were an end of you, or at leaſt he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe ſuch patience that ſhould not lead you to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: as he did with the Devils, as ſoon as they had ſinned, he clapt his chains upon them, and reſerves them in chains of darkneſs; there is no ſuch patience of God towards them as to be any argument to draw them to repentance: therefore they cannot draw any encourageing concluſion from any work of Gods patience, as to bring
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46564:132"/> them towards God again: But al ſinners may do it that are the ſons of men. Hath God ſpared thy life at ſuch, and ſuch a time? know that in that work of his, he doth manifeſt his willingneſs to be reconciled unto thy Soul; as if a man hath an enemy at an advantage, and he wil not take it: Doth not this ſignifie that he is willing to be at peace with him?

               <p>SEcondly, God hath manifeſted himſelf very willing to be reconciled unto ſinners in this; that he hath made it to be the great Maſter-piece of al his works to provide a way for Reconciliation of thee unto him. The Lord hath wrought ſo wonderfully for the children of men, rather than for Angels, in ſending his Son, &amp; making of him a curſe for our ſins. In this the Lord proclaims a loud voice to al the world; O! be it known to al you ſinners that I am willing to be reconciled to you. We need not name Scripture for this, for the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel is ful of this; O! the heart of God is much in this work of Reconciliation; al the arguments in the world, al the expreſſions that poſſible could have been, could never have held forth this, ſo much as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this proclaimation that God hath ſent his Son into the world to die for mans ſin: this holds it forth, and proclaims it (with the loudeſt voice that poſſible can be) that God is infinitly willing to be reconciled unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

               <p>AND then thirdly, after this work of God ſending his Son, mark how God doth expreſs himſelfe to the Children of men! he doth profeſs that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein he doth more glory than he doth in this; to ſhew mercy to ſinners: he doth make account that the chefeſt glory he hath in the world it is to ſhew mercy unto ſiners. Certainly that that his ſoule is ſo wel pleaſed with, &amp; that that he accounts himſelf moſt honored by, is; when ſinners ſhal come in unto him to repent, that he may be reconciled unto them. If a man ſhould do thus that hath an enemy, and ſhould manifeſt this to ſome of his friends that ſit at his table, as to ſay, ſuch an one is an enemy to me: but O! how fain would I have him come in, that there might be peace between him and I, and I would count it as great an honor as ever I had in my life; would not any one ſay, this man were willing to be reconciled; certainly God doth ſo, and therefore in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. the place you know about the 6. verſe, the Lord, when he was proclamming his glory that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired, and the Lord promiſed, he promiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Latter end of the 33.

               <p>FOurthly, the Lord expreſſes this his willingneſs to be reconciled to ſinners with a ſigh, as when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his deſire after ſinners with a ſigh, which is a note of earneſtneſs of deſire, and that you have in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. and 24. verſe: O! that there were ſuch a heart in them.

O! that there were: ſo ſaith God, O! that they had ſuch an heart; that they would fear me, and walke in my waies, and why doth God expreſſe this?

Is there a man that ſhould be the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of the whole world? a man that were famous in al the world. Let a poor Soul, a penitent heart come in, and cloſe with Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt, and rowl it ſelf upon mercy in Chriſt for Reconciliation; this poor Soul, (though the meaneſt that were poſſible to be immagined in the whole Nation) is a more glorious work in Gods Eye; then the moſt glorious work of the greateſt Conqueror of the earth. If thou wert able to rule the Sea; if thou wert able to govern al the world; if thou wert able to command the Heavens, it would not be ſuch a glorious work in the Eyes of God as that is to come and lay hold upon his Son, as he is tendred in the Goſpel. If you ſhould give al your Almes to the poor, and your body to be burnt: yet it were nothing to the work of beleeving in his Son. In <hi>John</hi> 3 God is moſt diſpleaſed with not beleeving in his Son. As if God ſhould ſay, it's true, you are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies to me, and you have lived in waies of enmity againſt me; O! you have provoked me al your daies; when you were yong, a drunken, unclean, prophane Youth; a Lyar, a Swearer, a Sabboth-breaker &amp;c. but yet you live to hear the voice of the Goſpel ſounding in your ears, and to have the offer of Jeſus Chriſt to your Souls for the pardon of your ſins: Now be it known to you; al the Oaths that ever you ſwore, al your Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, al your Drunkenneſs, al your Uncleaneſs, al al your Sabboth-breaking, (put them altogether) they wil not provoke me ſo much: as rejecting of my Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, that I tender to you. That is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the world; al the other iniquities wil not ſink you down ſo deep in Hel as not comming to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt; to lay hold upon the Grace of God, that is tendred to you in the Goſpel.

               <p>FUrther God manifeſts himſelf willing to be reconciled in this; in the waies of his dealing with wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men; in ſending his Grace to allure the hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the Lord ſends his mercy, to ſpread al the beauty; and luſtre thereof before the Sons of men; al the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Glory of it before the Soul, that it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Soul of the ſinner to come in unto him, (he doth not meerly ſend and ſeek to him) but that he might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the hearts of men with love and mercy; this is Gods way, to cauſe his mercy to ſtand before the Soul, and to ſpread the beauty, and excellency of it, that it move, and entice, and allure the hearts of men, that ſo God (as it were by coards of Love) might draw the hearts of poor ſinful men unto him. If God did but ſcare men ſo come in to him, it were ſomwhat; but it is this which we have cauſe to bleſs God for; if the Lord come in never ſuch a terrible way to force us to come in, that ſo there might be made up peace between God, and us, the Lord (beſides that way of terror and wrath) (though ſomtimes he wil uſe that way to ſtop men in the courſe of their ſins, and to force them to come in) he goes forth, and doth ſend his mercy, to ſtand before the Soul, and to ſpread the beauty, excellency, and glory of it before the heart of the ſinner, that ſo it might allure the ſinner to come in: ſo God ſpeaks of his people in the 2 <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 14. There was a great breach between Iſrael and God at the time, and God to make up the breach, (when
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46564:136"/> he would be pacified towards Iſrael) he expreſſes it in this manner; Therefore behold, I wil allure her, and in the 11. of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. mark! I draw them with the cords of a man, and with the coards of love; I delt with them in a ſuitable way, becauſe that mans Nature had rather be drawn, than driven) and cannot ſo wel bear to be driven with violence as to be drawn by love: Therefore (ſaith God) I wil deal with them according to their own Nature, and in a ſuiteable way. I draw them with the coards of a man and with bonds of Love; here are the gracious expreſſions of God unto wretched ſinners, to break their hearts that they may come in, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him: God takes away the terror of his greatneſs, and comes in loving, and ſweet waies to draw the hearts of ſinners. I appeal unto your conſciences, have not you that know what it is to be reconciled unto God, had the Lord ſetting the riches of his Grace before your Soules? have not you ſeen the alluring attributes of God preſented before you to gain your hearts unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>ANother is this; that the Lord is willing to yeild unto his creatures, (as farr as may be) to yeild to the creature (I ſay) (as farr as he can with honor) for ſuch is the way of the Goſpel in bringing ſinners to God; that God hath yeilded to his creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as farr as can be conceived to be done with honor (he cannot deny himſelf; and his Glory:) But take it thus farr, that God muſt have his Glory; it is impoſſible that God ſhould yeild further
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46564:137"/> to the creature than he hath done, Whereas God might have required ſatisfaction in our own perſons, he hath yeilded to this; I wil take it in another; this is the condition of the Covenant of Grace, from that of the Covenant of works; the covenant of works required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience in our own perſons: ſo that if we did not obey, it required ſaitsfaction of us. Now in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace there is a high conſideration, (as it were) God is content to take it in a ſuerty; He wil be content for our parts if there be uprightneſs, if there be but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, if there be but willingneſs of heart, (though he ſees that we do provoake him day by day) wel ſaith God, (whereas I ſtood upon perfect obedience in the Covenant of works) now ſaith God, I wil he ſatisfied with the wil for the deed, if there be but uprightneſs of heart, (though there be many weakneſſes) yet I wil be willing, and content with that. Now doth not a man ſhew himſelf willing to be reconciled unto another, when he ſhal ſay, wel let there be any terms, propounded that can be, I wil yeild to any tearms ſo far as I can with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? I muſt not diſhonor my ſelf: but ſo farr as can be I yeild. God hath done thus; he profeſſes to the world, that ſo far as he can he hath yielded to us; Now if we ſhould not except of the termes that he requires (for they are ſuch tearms, ſo reaſonoble, ſo equal, that cannot be imagined leſs) there cannot be leſs required of the Creature, then is by the Creator.</p>
               <p>Object, <hi>You ſay, beleeving is a great matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But conſider it in its ſelfe, it is not ſuch a great matter but only in relation unto Chriſt, in its own nature, it is but as a poor begger that puts forth his hand to take the almes, and it is God that gives it to us two: Now if we do any thing, what can we do leſs then receive, (eſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we have a hand given us by God wherewith to receive) as if a begger had an alms promiſed him if he would come and take it. Oh! but ſaith the begger I am lame, I cannot go, and my hand is withered, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46564:137"/> ſtretch it forth. Wel, he that would give the alms ſaith, he wil help the beggar thither, he wil help him to legs to go, and he wil heal his hand and give it ſtrength whereby he ſhal put it forth to receive the alms; only do not ſtrugle againſt me, do not reſiſt me: I wil be with you, you ſhal leane upon mee, I wil give you ſtilts. Is not here as much conſideration as can be? and ſo it is in the work of reconciliation of ſinners unto God; he gives alms, and he gives the hand wherewith to receive it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 70.</hi> The tenth argument: Manifeſting the exceeding wilingneſs of God and Chriſt to be reconciled to ſinners.</head>
               <p>And then, the Lord manifeſts his willingneſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto ſinners in this; he doth profeſs unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the greateſt ſins that ever they have committed ſhal not be a hinderance to bear of this work of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: The Lord I ſay profeſſes this to ſinners; he ſends his meſſengers to tel them; that though (perhaps) they may be conſcious to themſelves of ſome vile thing that they have committed, whereby they may think that God wil never paſs by that ſin: But God to take away the objection that they ſhal never be able to ſay ſo; he doth make that as cleer as any thing in this world; that there is not the greateſt ſin that ever thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (except that one againſt the Holy Spirit) no other ſin ſhal barre or hinder the work of thy reconciliation: and certainly where that ſin is committed, the heart wil never deſire to come in to be reconciled to God, but flies in the face of God to revenge himſelf upon God. But if thou haſt a heart that deſires to come in to God, that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46564:138"/> is an infallible argument that thou haſt not committed that ſin. I might give you a great many Scriptures for this; to ſhew that God profeſſes that there is not any ſin that ſhal make the bar in the way between him and thee; in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1, 18. <hi>Come now let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord &amp;c.</hi> Yea, come now let us reaſon together. Thus God deals in a familiar way with ſinners, as if a Malefactor were before the Prince ſhaking, quivering, and trembling, fearing that the Prince would have his life; being conſcious to himſelf of abundance of evil that he hath been guilty of, and the Prince ſhould go and take him by the hand, and ſay, Come let us riſe up; let us reaſon together; though your offences be great; yet that ſhal not be a bar between you and me. This is that we have authority to proclaime even in the name of the Lord God of Heaven; and to every poor ſoul, and to the worſt of ſinners, and to the greateſt of ſinners that are here, or can be heer now, before the Lord, in his name, this we ſay, there is nothing paſt between God and you; no ſin that is yet paſt that ſhal be your undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the eternal deſtruction of your ſouls: But it wil be ſome ſin that is yet to come; ſomewhat that is yet to come wil be the eternal deſtruction of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this Congregation. Its true, if God ſmite thee now it wil be the ſin that is paſt: but if God let thee live this day, it is rather for ſomething that is yet to come, than for any thing that is paſt: for the continuance in the hardneſs of heart, and your unbeleife from this time forward; rather then for what is paſt. If one had run in arrears, and incurred a great deal of puniſhment, enough to his undoing; if this ſhould come to be ſaid unto him; Thus far you have run: But here is a proclamation; there is nothing that is paſt that ſhal be charged upon you but look to it for the time to come: I do not ſay, that al the ſinns that are paſt God wil never reckon, but thus, that he wil never reckon with any of you for what is paſt, but for ſome cauſe of evil
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46564:138"/> that you ſhal be guilty of for the future; that muſt go along with it, and that may cauſe God to bring that, that is paſt over again: but that that wil be your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and deſtruction wil be ſomthing that is to come, and if you continue in your wicked waies, then that wil bring al over again. But now if you had a heart this day, at this preſent, to fal downe before the lord, to ſeeke to make up your peace with him, and to cloſe with the grace of God in his ſon: I can bouldly pronounce that al your ſins, that are paſt, are done away; O! remember this, this gracious offer of God in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.18. whatſoever you have been before, yet that needs be no diſcouragement unto you; it is the continuance in your iniquity that wil undo you; and now wil not this ſoul juſtifie God at the great day? muſt not God needs be juſtified if any ſinner in this congregation be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt? I ſay this argument ſhal riſe up againſt them, and ſhal juſtifie God againſt you. Now God wil ſay, you that lived a long time in ſin, you heard that after ſo many years ſinning, that whatſoever your ſins were before, yet ſome things that were then to come would be your deſtruction, or els you ſhould never be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and yet you would venture for the time to come; you would be bould to adde to that heape of your ſins that have been ſo longe a making, and thereby bring al your ſins upon you that you had committed before. And therefore righteous is God in the Condemnation of this ſinner, (wee ſpeak of the willingneſs of God to be reconcilled unto ſinners) to that end that you might come in, and be reconcilled, or otherwiſe that the juſtice of God may be cleere at the great day, and this is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al end of al the manifeſtation of Gods goodneſs unto ſinners; that he might cleer himſelfe at the great day in thoſe that ſhal periſh. There are a great many things yet more behind, where in the willingneſs of God to be reconcilled unto ſinners is further to be ſet forth: yet I know there are Objections that ly in your
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46564:139"/> mindes. How can we come? And if God be ſo willing, he may bring our hearts to be willing to be reconciled to him; we ſhal diſcourſe theſe more at lardge; only for the preſent, I deſire to preſent, before you this; the manifeſtation of the goodneſs of God towards ſinners to gain upon their hearts; that they might be reconciled unto him, and I ſhould be very ſory to open al theſe things in ſuch a congregation as this is, if it were not to gain ſome ſouls: (for it's like enough that ſome wil be hardened) and now if ſome ſhould be hardened, and others ſhould not be gained: what a miſerable thing were it? I might make this as an evidence, how willing God is to be reconciled unto ſiners; that he would have the riches of his grace thus manifeſtd to gain ſiners to himſelf, though he knows that it wil be a means to harden others; he knows that it wil coſt the eternal damnation of many ſouls, and though he do know this: yet for al this ſaith God, let my wilingneſs to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilled be opened unto poor ſinners by the preaching of the goſpel, though it coſts many ſouls very dear, yet (for the love I bear to poor ſouls) let it be made known to the face of them al. Now if God were not ſtrongly ſet to do good to ſouls, ſuerly he would not venture the damnation of other ſouls ſo much. But ſaith God, let their ſouls go, rather than my willingneſs to be Reconciled unto others, ſhould not be declared unto them.</p>

               <p>THe next argument that ſhewes the willingneſs of God to be reconciled unto ſinners is this; The Lord in his word, doth uſe very powerful, and ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw the heart to come in to be reconciled; this is that evidence; (I ſay,) that the Lord is willing, by the ſtrong reaſons that God doth uſe in his word to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of ſinners, to bring them in to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he doth not meerly offer mercy; he doth not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet before the ſoul his mercy. But the Lord labors with ſtrong reaſons, motives, and arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and gain the hearts of ſinners unto himſelf; to come in to be reconciled unto him; as now when a man doth offer peace, it is ſomewhat, and when he doth it in a generous loving way of curteſie that is more: but then, when he doth ſend ſtrong arguments, to perſwad, &amp; wil not readily take a denial, but ſends ſuch &amp; ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; doth conſider before hand what wil be moſt likely to perſwade the heart of ſuch a man. What can I conceive wil gaine his heart moſt? What can I think? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there ſhould be a man, between whom &amp; you there hath been a falling out, &amp; you ſhould know that when he is alone in his cloſſet, he is thinking thus with himſelf; What arguments can I conceive may take the heart of ſuch a man to perſwade him: to come in to be at peace with me? what can I think may be the moſt prevalent? That wil I certainly uſe to perſwade him. But undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly it is ſo with God. God looks upon the Children of men, and doth conſider what argumentt wil take their hearts moſt? the ſcripture is exceeding ful of prevalent, &amp; powerful arguments, to perſwade the hearts of men to come in, to be reconciled unto God: [Arguments]
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46564:140"/> ſometimes taken from the equity of Gods waies towards them, and their unequal wayes towards him; Are not my wayes equal ſaith God, and your wayes unequal? Is there any thing that I require of you but righteous? do not I ſpeak righteous? Sometimes he uſes arguments from the abſolute neceſſity that lies upon ſinners to come and be reconciled unto God, ſhewing them that certainly they wil be loſt, undone, and eternally damned if they do not come in. <hi>He that beleeveth not, the wrath of God abides upon him.</hi> You are loſt and undone crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures except you do come in. And ſometimes arguments taken from the excellency of the benefit, and profit that there is in comming in to God, and being reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al the Glorious promiſes of the Goſpel, are ſo many powerful arguments to draw the hearts of ſinners to run in to be reconciled unto God. I might be very large in this; in ſhewing of the particular arguments that God doth uſe: but take that one ful argument that we have to perſwade ſinners to come in, In <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turne you at my reproof; behold</hi> I <hi>wil pour my ſpirit upon you;</hi> I <hi>wil make known my word unto you:</hi> He ſpeaks here to ſimple ones, Scorners, Fools; [Turne you at my reproofe; behold, I wil pour my ſpirit out upon you] (ſaith God) as if God ſhould ſay, though you are Scorners: yet the truth is; my heart works towards you, my heart doth yearn towards you, and if you would but turne to me, I would pour forth my heart to you: you ſhal have my very ſpirit, my very heart let out unto you, if you wil turne unto me. What an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is here to prevail with the hardeſt hearts in the world? For God himſelf to come and ſay unto a ſinner, to one that hath Scorned him and his wayes, and to a Fool that hath gone on in waies of folly, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for God to come and ſay unto him; Oh wretched ſinner! come in, come in, turne to me, turne to me, for my heart is ful, my heart is top ful, turn to me; I wil pour forth my heart to thee; Al thoſe promiſes of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46564:140"/> giving reſt to thy ſoul; of giving life eternal, eternal ſalvation, Glory, Peace, and Comfort, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhal al be made good to thee. The Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuites himſelf unto us in ſuch arguments, ſo cloſe as may out-bid other comforts that we have in the word in any waies of ſin: and therefore tels them of Hony, and Milk, and Rayment, and Gold, and Silver, and al ſuch things as are precious in the eyes of men; ſuch as are of eſteem with us, and tenders his Son unto us upon ſuch kind of notions that every one of them might be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent arguments to gaine the hearts of ſinners to come in unto God: this is the way of God; that he comes into the hearts of his people, with the moſt prevalent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſuch reaſons as one would think were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be gainſaid. I appeal to the hearts of thoſe who have been acquainted with the work of God upon them. How did God come to your hearts? did he not come with mighty ſtrong arguments to you? The Devil he tempted, and he comes with ſtrong arguments, and God he comes, and tempts with ſtrong arguments; the Devil draws, and God draws; Gods mercies draw ſtronger than the Devil can: Oh! it was mercy to that ſoul, and (the truth is) when the Lord pleaſes to work effectually upon the ſoul, he can preſent ſtronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw the heart of a ſinner to him, than it is poſſible for the Devil to prevaile againſt.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46564:141"/> through al miſts, and il conceipts of the Goſpel, and ſhews unto the Soul the excellency and beuty of his Son, and of the glorious things that are in the Goſpel: then the Devil comes the other way. Indeed ſaith he there are glorious things, but thou art unworthy; thou art a wretched, baſe, vile Creature, and canſt thou think that God ſhould grant ſuch things as theſe to thee? now the Lord anſwers this Objection; What ſaith God? Come without Money; What is that? that is; though thou haſt no worthineſs in thy ſelf, though thou haſt no a, bilities to buy any thing that is good; yet come, come yet &amp; cloſe with my Grace; that ſhal make thee rich enough; thou ſhalt have money enough that way: Come without mony &amp; without price, let never that Objection hinder thee; that thou art unworthy &amp; unable to do any thing: the Lord cals thee without Money, &amp; offers freely to thee, &amp; therefore in the latter end of the Book of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is ſaid in the laſt Chapter the 17. ver. <hi>And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Bride ſay Come, and let him that heareth ſay Come, and let him that is a thirſt, Come; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wil, let him take of the water of life freely.</hi> How ſhal I ever think to have it?

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O! but there may lie another Objection; Thus, it may be, the Lord wil require, though he requires nothing that I ſhal do before hand, but wil grant his mercy freely: but when I am come, then perhaps things that are hard, wil be required at my hands: O! the waies of God they are hard waies, and then <hi>I</hi> muſt live ſo ſtrictly, then I muſt make Conſcience of my waies, and ſo abandon al my ſins and Luſts, and wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46564:142"/> men. I appeal to you; have not ſome of your hearts been kept off from Jeſus Chriſt, and the waies of God meerly upon ſome ſuch temptations as theſe? and indeed perhaps at firſt it may be ſo til the nature of a man is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>But mark how this objection is taken away, when ſinners are called to Chriſt, (I ſuppoſe you know the place) <hi>Come unto me, ye that are weary, and heavy laden, and</hi> I <hi>wil give you reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that concerns the former, and then afterwards when Chriſt had ſaid ſo; come to me ye that are weary &amp; heavy laden, and I wil give you reſt; <hi>take my yoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, my burthen &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems then we muſt be yoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and burthened: But marke what follows in verſ. 30. <hi>For my yoak is eaſy, and my burthen is light</hi> (as if Chriſt ſhould ſay) never harken to ſuch a tentation of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in my wayes: I aſſure you beforehand you wil find that the Devil doth but gul you, deceive, and cozen you, I wil warrant you that beforehand; that <hi>I</hi> wil lay no yoak upon you, but you ſhal ſay when you come to beare it, it is an eaſy yoak, and though it be a burthen, yet you ſhal acknowledg it is a light burthen. This I dare ſay in the name of God unto al; come in al you that ſtand off from the waies of God; though the waies of God may ſeem hard to you at firſt, yet I dare ſay from God unto you, that you wil find the wayes of God more eaſy to you at laſt than ever you did in the waies of ſin: <hi>For certainly there is more trouble in the waies of ſin than can be in the waies of God.</hi> And when God cals upon you to come in to be reconciled, he doth profeſs this to you; that he wil require nothing of you but that which ſhal be more pleaſant to you than any wayes of ſin that you lived in before: there be more comforts, and joy, and that for the preſent, than ever you had in the waies of ſin, do but ask any one that hath made tryal of this, and deſire them to ſpeak their conſciences to thee (I meane thoſe that have had any apprehenſion of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46564:142"/> the love of Chriſt to them) yea have you began to walk in wiſdomes wayes, which are pleaſantneſs, and to tread in thoſe paths which are ſtrowed with roſes, and paved with peace? pray then ſpeak plainly, how do you find your ſelf? is it not better now than it was before? do you not find more eaſe, more comfort, and joy in theſe waies of God than you did before in any way of Sin? Oh ſuch a one wil profeſs unto you that they find more comfort than ever they did before; they find more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in communion with God in his wayes in one day, than they found in the waies of ſin in al their lives before, the Holy Spirit in pleading with the hearts of men ſaith the ſame <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſs, and her paths are peace.</hi> If you wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the ſpirit of God, the waies of Godlineſs are waies of pleaſantneſs, and al her paths, are paths of peace. What ſhould hinder you then? It is neither your unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs that can be any hinderance nor the hardſhip of the way. Theſe are the two great blocks that lie in the way; and God doth fully take away theſe in ſcripture; and if there be any other objection, I dare undertake bring what objections you can (give me but a litle time) to find out ſome manifeſt word, or other in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſhal meet with the very objection. Then how doth this argue Gods exceeding willingneſs to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to ſinners? If a man ſend his meſſenger to ſuch a one to offer peace, and he thinks beforehand; Oh! but he wil have this and this objection againſt me; but ſaith he to his ſervant that is imployed in the buſineſs, you ſhal anſwer this objection thus, and the other objection thus.</p>

               <p>ANother evidence of Gods willingneſs to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led is this; that God is ſo importunate with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he uſes ſuch ſtrong arguments, that he firſt takes away objections, and then he is ſo importunate, he doth not meerly ſatisfy himſelf with offering of mercy: but he is very importunate in the work, and the importunity of God appeares. Firſt in this; that the ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes God crying out after ſinners: not only ſeeking out after ſinners, but calling, and crying: ſo the words in the Original are, of Gods beſeeching to be reconciled, of God calling to ſinners, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. It is ſaid of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that it cries, the Lord cryes out, and that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>When he makes a proclamation he begins firſt with, Oh! yes, Oh! every one that thirſteth come to the waters, and he that hath no mony, and there is the offer of Chriſt with a proclamation.</p>
               <p>Further, Gods importunity is manifeſt in this; that he comes over again with a thing, and is not content with the expreſſing of himſelf. But he doth it again, and again, and again he is at it, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>verſ. the firſt,</hi> Se how many times there is crying in one verſe, Ho! every one that thirſteth come ye; and he that hath no mony come; and come the third time; three times in one verſe ſaith God come to ſinners, and then in the third verſe, <hi>Incline your eare, and come unto mee (ſaith God) and hear, and your ſouls ſhal live, and I wil make an everlaſting Covenant with you;</hi> there is another promiſe; Even the ſure mercies of <hi>David:</hi> ſo hear in one ſhort ſcripture four times come, ſaith
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46564:143"/> God; O! how importunate is God with ſinners? God doth not do with us, as commonly wee do with him, God ſeeks after ſinners more earneſtly than ſinners ſeek after God; thus we ſeek to God for mercy; we pray to God for mercy; we content our ſelves with praying once, and ſeldome looke after our prayers what becoms of them; but God he cries to us to come and if we do not come the firſt time, then he crys come, come, &amp; come four times together we are ready to think if our petitions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated twice in prayer, it is atautology &amp; this ſhews the earneſtneſs of the ſpirit of God in it, and he is exceeding willing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 74.</hi> The Fourteenth Argument: manifeſting the exceeding willingneſs of God to be reconciled to ſinners.</head>
               <p>ANother evidence is this; when yet ſiners do not come, yet the lord leaves them not; but he doth then appeal to the very conſcinces of ſinners, and deales with them that way; and that is very powerful; he deals with ſinners that way to breake their hearts: (when after al his arguments they com not in) then the lord appeals to their own conſciences, &amp; then wil plead with them in a way of appealing to their conſciences, why they ſhould not come in and yeild unto him; and this way is verry powerful to prevail with ſinners. If you would go, and prevail with any one for a thing that you have a deſire to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, what courſe do you take? either you ſend to them, or go to them, and then you open the caſe to them, and yet they are not moved &amp; then you bring powerful argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwad them, and yet they do not move them then you take away al their objections, and yet that doth not prevail upon them; then you do importune them, and if that do not overcome them, what is the next way you take? then you appeal to their owne conſciences, then ſay you, nay, I appeal to your own conſcience, whether
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46564:144"/> I have ſaid it or no; I wil even leave it to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and judg of it in the preſence of God let your own conſcience be your judg, and ſomtimes this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes more than al the arguments in the world. When you appeal to a mans one conſcience, that he doth deal unequally, and very il; that he doth not yeild: but God doth thus he doth apeal unto mens conſciences I wil give yo ſuome ſcripture for it in the 43. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. Put me in rememberance; let us plead together; declare thou that thou muſt be juſtified; come (ſaith God) let us hear what you can ſay; let us plead together; Declare thou that thou mayeſt be juſtified; declare it, ſay what thou canſt, try whether you or I be in the right way, I wil even be contented to leave it to you (only let us plead, and declare what we can) But that place ſeemes yet to be more ful that you have in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2, 3, you have often expreſſions of Gods pleading with his people in the ninth verſe, and then you have it again at leaſt three times in this Chapter that the lord ſaith he wil plead in v. 23. you have it again, wherefore wil you plead with me? &amp;c. and then in the 35. verſ. Behold I wil plead with thee ſaith God, but now God pleads thus in his pleading, he wil leave it, he wil appeal to the very conſciences of men, and that you have in <hi>Exek.</hi> 18.25. verſ. yet you ſay, the way of the lord is not equal, hear O! houſe of Iſrael, (as if he ſhould ſay) conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence anſwer, Is not my way equal? wil not your owne conſciences anſwer you thus? that his waies are equal? the lord is content to plead with his people, &amp; the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his pleading is a leaving it to their conſciences, to the people, (as if God ſhould ſay thus) as he doth often) God comes by his ſpirit in the miniſtry of his word. I appeal to you, (hath he not often done ſo)? and ſaith, do you think in your very conſciences that theſe waies that you walk in are right? &amp; my waies are they good? is it any way equal that wretched ſinful creatures ſhould take their liberty to go on al their daies and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the luſts of their own vaine hearts, and now,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46564:144"/> when they can ſin no more nor longer, that then they ſhould cry to God for mercy, and that then he ſhould pardon them, and accept them unto his favour? Is this equal? is not the lord infinitly more worthy of al the ſtrength thou haſt if it were ten thouſand times more than it is, than that thou ſhouldeſt have given it up to thy luſts and vanities? Conſcience, ſpeak whether God be not moſt worthy of al? and what wert thou made for? no other end but meerly to eat and drink and ſatisfie thy fleſh, and have thy luſts heere for a while? doſt thou thinke in thy concience that God did intend no other end for thee when he ſent thee into the world? you have been upon your ſick bedds and cried to God, and have promiſed to God better obedience, now are your waies equal to take your liberty to ſin after God hath thus delivered you, and after God hath preſerved your life when you were at the very brinke of death, and that death was ready to deliver you up into the hands of eternal miſery; and do you think that this was Gods end in preſerving your life that you might have more time to ſin againſt him, and might ſpend the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of your ſtrength in bringing diſhonor to his Name? was this Gods end in preſerving your life? God might have ſtruck you one blow more, and ſent you down to eternal miſery, and then God ſhould have had no more diſhonor of you, but ſhould have had the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Juſtice upon you: Now do you think that this is the end why God did preſerve you, that you ſhould have more years added to your life, that you ſhould have more time to ſin againſt him? This argues Gods willingneſs to be reconciled, that the Lord is thus plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with you: and let me ſpeak to every one in this place that hath felt God pleading thus with them, know, that the Lord by this work of his, doth ſtrive with thee to bring thee to be reconciled unto him. This is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than the ſtriving of the Spirit of God himſelf with you, though perhaps you think this is troubleſom to you. Many men and women when they have their
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46564:145"/> conſciences pleading thus, they think it is troubleſom. Oh wretched man or woman that thou art, this work of Conſcience is nothing but God pleading with thee to ſave thy Soul: Thou haſt ſtood againſt his Word that hath been preached to thee, and now God ſeeks to thee the other way by his Spirit to ſtrive in thy Conſcience, he appeals to thy own Conſcience, that ſo thou mayeſt be brought in to be reconciled unto him. But when God hath no mind to be reconciled, then ſaith God to Conſcience, let him alone; and then the ſinner goes on with a hard heart, and bleſſes himſelf that his Conſcience is quiet: Oh no, no, Conſcience is quiet, but God hath left laboring any more with thee.</p>

               <p>BUt further, the Lord ſhews his willingeſs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to ſinners in this, that when this way wil not prevail you wil think there were never another way to be found, yet there is another way when God doth deal in a familiar way as man to man, when he hath brought his Arguments, and anſwered Objections, and been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, and pleaded, then truly ſometimes, (if it be a tender hearted man) perhaps his heart doth even break within him, and he is ready to burſt out with tears, becauſe of the ſtoutneſs and frowardneſs, of ſuch a one, that wil ruine himſelf and ſtand out againſt ſo much reaſon, and that prevailing more than al the other arguments, eſpecially when he is to ſpeak to one that he hath any reference to, as a Father, the Father perhaps perſwades the Child, and anſwers what the Child hath to ſay, is importunate, appeals to the conſcience of the Child, yet he ſtands out ſtubbornly, and at length the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46564:145"/> Father or Mother can hold no longer, but burſt out in tears, lamenting the hardneſs of heart of ſuch a one. Now if a Child that is ſtubborn ſhould look in at a key-hole, and ſee his Father, or Mother, ſhedding of tears, becauſe of his hardneſs of heart, then the Child wil cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be convinced of this. Now certainly my Father loves me, and al he doth, it is but for my good, certainly thus did Chriſt, when he came to Hjeruſalem he wept over it, Upon what ground? O! that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that concern thy peace: O! that thou hadſt known, &amp; Chriſt fel a weeping. Now we are to know this, that the tears of Chriſt at that time concern ſinners now, as verily &amp; truly as they did concern ſinners at that very inſtant, and we are to look upon Chriſts cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adge of himſelf to ſinners in former times, as at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, concerning us, and amongſt us. Now I would appeal to you; ſuppoſe Chriſt were born in this world in the fleſh again as he was, and ſhould come and look towards this commonwealth and ſhould come hither; and ſay, O! <hi>England, England,</hi> O! that thou hadſt known the things that concern thy peace, and ſhould weep over <hi>London,</hi> or weep over <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as he did over that Citty of <hi>Hjeruſalem,</hi> Would not this break our hearts? Would not we take this as a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Chriſt was very derſirous of the peace of this Citty or place? Now concerning every particular Soul, it is true, and every one ſhould make uſe of that Scripture, and apply it to themſelves, as if Chriſt ſtood weeping over it, and ſay, Oh that thou hadſt known at leaſt in this thy day the things that concern thy peace, Would not this break your hearts? this Town that Chriſt ſends his Goſpel amongſt. And ſuppoſe you could ſee him bodily, Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding here, and one tear trickling down after another, &amp; ſaying, O! that this people did but know the things that concern their peace, at leaſt in this their day when they have a price put into their hands, before the Goſpel Sun goes down, or
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46564:146"/> is eclipſed, ſurely we ſhould ſay that Chriſts tears argue the rowling of his bowels towards them, it may be their time wil not continue long. O! that they knew it now. If you did ſee Chriſt thus weeping; I ſuppoſe this would be a mighty argument to you, that Chriſt were willing to be reconciled to you. We are I ſay to make uſe of that Scripture as if it were now. And though Chriſt doth not ſhed tears now in Heaven, yet there is as much compaſſion in the heart of Chriſt now, as ever there was here upon earth he hath loſt no compaſſion by going to Heaven, and therefore know that Jeſus Chriſt doth look at this day upon this Congregation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular Souls (it is propable) Chriſt more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially eyes and ſaith in his very heart, Oh! that ſuch a Soul, ſuch a Servant, ſuch a Youth, Oh that they did but know the things that concerns their peace, for now the Goſpel is opened to them, and a day of ſalvation is made known to them, and they are labored to be drawn from their evil waies to embrace me; and Oh that they did know theſe things that concern their peace. And thus it appears how willing God is to be reconciled.</p>
               <p>I ſhal afterwards ſhew ſomwhat about Chriſt in a more ſpecial manner that ſinners ſhould come and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God.</p>

               <p>FUrther, there is an other evidence of the willingneſs of God to be reconciled unto ſinners and that is this. The Lord doth foreſee, that after he hath done al to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto ſinners, let him do what he can, the Lord foreſees what a little honor he ſhal have (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46564:146"/> at leaſt in this world by them) he ſees that after they are brought in that yet ſtil there wil be abundance of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and they wil diſhonor God extreamely now, and wil grieve the Holy ſpirit that doth thus draw them; he ſees that they wil walk more offenſively, and it may be, Scandalouſly towards their bretheren, and diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or the profeſſion of religion. God ſees what a deal of do, and ſtir, he ſhal have with thoſe that he doth bring in to himſelf, and yet for al this he goes on with his work and labor with the hearts of ſinners, notwithſtanding al that he doth foreſee. And then the laſt of al is this; that after the Lord hath uſed al theſe meanes to bring ſinners to come in, and break their hearts that they might be reconciled to him, (though they that ſtand out againſt him, and plead, and weep over them, and mourn) yet the Lord is content to waite, and yet a long time upon ſinners, and not to take advantage againſt them for their rejecting of this Grace of his that he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to them. That ſcripture I named before is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>And therefore wil the Lord wait that he may be gratious.</hi> Oh! how many yeares hath the Lord waited upon ſom of you? We have cauſe to ſtand and admire at the Grace of God that ever he would once offer mercy to us; that after ſo many offers and ſuch importunities to prevail with our hearts, and we frowardly have rejected this Grace, that now God ſhould waite upon us to heal our ſouls, and at length to overcome us; Oh! this manifeſts the goodneſs of God, and the tenderneſs of his heart to be willing to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto ſinners, and therefore in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. Mark what God ſaith unto ſinners in the laſt verſe; <hi>I have ſeen thy Adulteries, and thy Neighings, and the Lewdneſs of thy Whordomes, and thy abominations; Wo unto thee Oh Jeruſalem! wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhal it once be?</hi> Saith God. Oh! that once it might be; I am content to ſtay again, and again, Oh! when ſhal it once be? Let not al my labor be in vaine; Oh! here is
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46564:147"/> the fullneſs of the expreſſions of God, and that place likewiſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. Is obſervable for this purpoſe the 17. and 18. verſes, <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was</hi> I <hi>wroth, and Smote him;</hi> I <hi>hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heat,</hi> I <hi>have ſeen his waies and wil heal him &amp;c.</hi> Though he went on, and was worth; yet (ſaith God) I have ſeen his waies, and wil heal him; I wil not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; I wil be content after al their froward rejections of al the offers of Grace, yet I wil heal them for al that. The frowardneſs is that that hath reference (not only to unprofitableneſs under afflictions) but when one is dealt kindly withal, and doth not anſwer according to his kindneſs, but wil have his own wil ſuch a one doth go on frowardly. Now then if we could put al theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that have been named of Gods willingneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners to bring them in to be reconciled to him; Oh Lord! how infinite would the Grace, and goodneſs of God appeare? How were God to be glorified in his Grace?</p>
               <p>I ſee I cannot poſſibly come to theſe things, that I have heretofore propounded; As what needs al this and the like? But that muſt be done, or the reaſons why God doth deal thus.</p>
               <p>A word or too at this time for that; why God doth do al this, why doth God deal thus with ſinners in ſuch a manner?</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is becauſe mercy pleaſes him <hi>Micha.</hi> 7.18. there God makes a large promiſe of pardon of ſin, becauſe mercy pleaſeth him. Now that that is pleaſing unto any creature; that the creature loves to do it, and loves to do it to the ful, to the height, as al pleaſure you know, to enjoye the creature; to eate, and drink, and ſport is very pleaſing to a voluptuous man, and therefore he doth deſire to have this to the ful: a large bag of Gold pleaſes a covetous man, therefore he is never ſatisfied, but would have it to the ful; Honor
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46564:147"/> pleaſeth an ambitious, man, and therefore he never hath enough: ſo mercy it pleaſes God, and therefore (as I may with Holy reverence ſpeak) God ſcarce thinks he hath ever done enough to ſhew the riches of his Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God doth it; becauſe the blood of his Son doth cry continually in his eares for mercy, and it is of ſuch infinite worth, and value and the obedience of his Son in ſhedding of his bloud it hath been ſo acceptable unto God, and is; that whoſoever this blood is pleaded for, the Lord muſt needs grant it to the utmoſt. Now it is the blood of Jeſus Chriſt that is ſhed for ſinners, that doth plead with God the Father; that al this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be ſhewed. It is ſaid in the ſcripture, that the blood of Chriſt ſpeaks better things than the blood of Abel; the blood of Abel cries loude for vengeance; vengance Lord againſt ſinners: But the blood of Chriſt cries aloude merrcy, mercy, Lord for ſinners, and God heares the cry of his Sons blood. What is this that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries? The blood of my Son for mercy for ſinners: let them have mercy, yea let them have mercy to the ful. Then the fludgates of mercy come to be opened, though (if it were not for the blood of Chriſt) the patience of God would let out ſome common favors: but when God comes to ſatisfy the cries of the blood of Chriſt for mercy ſaith God, open al the fludgates now, and let in ſtreams of mercy for ſinners; let mercy be ſhewed to the higheſt degree that can be, if the blood of my Son cry for it, it muſt be, (though it requires wonderful mercy) it muſt be great, rich, glorious mercy, it is not a drop, but had need of a Sea, of mercies to anwſwer it.</p>
               <p>I but ſaith God, the blood of my ſon cryes for mercy, and though there be need of an infinite Ocean of mercy for to clenſe the ſoul of ſuch a ſinner, it muſt needs be granted; becauſe the blood of my ſon cryes for it. When you finde God manifeſting himſelfe to your ſouls in waies of mercy, it comes from the blood of Jeſus Chriſt that cries to God the father for mercy to be beſtowed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46564:148"/> on you, and this is the ſum and ſubſtance of al theſe expreſſions of Gods grace toward ſinners. (We thinke that ſo be very ſtrange that ever ſuch an infinite God ſhould condeſcend to ſinners, but when we come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the reaſon, we need not wonder at it; we ſee now from whence it al coms; it ſprings al from the ever living fountaine of the unſearchable rich grace of God in Chriſt, though (at the very reading) we may wonder that ever God ſhould do ſo; and perhaps ſome men may think theſe are but the ſtraynes of miniſters to make it ſo: but when we come to underſtand the bottom, the ground of al, then we muſt acknowledge the reality of it: no wonder, God ſhews mercy to ſuch ſouls ſo unworthy and ſo vild; why? Becauſe the blood of his ſon cryes for mercy.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 55.</hi> Chriſts willingneſs to be Reconciled to ſinners, further Opened.</head>
               <p>NOW before we come to anſwer the Objections, or to any application; there is yet ſomthing more to be opened unto you. [<hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>ſtead</hi>] as the heart of God is ſo ſet upon it to be reconciled unto ſinners: ſo is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> it is true, Chriſt is God: but Chriſt, and God are here ſpoken of ſeverally; Chriſt is the ſame God with the father: but he is God and man; God incarnate; God the mediator between the father and us: ſo that it wil be exceeding uſeful to ſhew <hi>how the heart of</hi> CHRIST <hi>is ſet upon Reconciliation of ſinners to God</hi> (for the Apoſtle doth come in the name of Chriſt, as wel as of God the father) now that the heart of Chriſt is in it; that appears in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46564:148"/> of the great worke of Reconciliation. That he hath undertaken it, and that ſo willingly as he hath done; Certainly if Chriſt had not been much ſet upon this work to bring ſinners to be reconciled unto the Father, he would never have undertaken ſuch a work, which he knew would prove ſo difficult to him, and he knew what it would coſt him: but yet he took it willingly, and delightfully, and for that compare thoſe two Scriptures the firſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo,</hi> I <hi>come: in the Volume of thy book it is written of me.</hi> It begins in ver. 6. <hi>Sacrifice, and offerring thou didſt not deſire, mine ears thou didſt open: burnt offerring, and ſin offering thou didſt not require: then ſaid I, Lo,</hi> I <hi>come: in the Volume of thy book it is written of me; I delight to do thy will Oh God.</hi> It is a <hi>Pſalm</hi> of Chriſt, and a Prophecy of him, and that it is of him it appears plainly if you compare the Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. at the beginning, and ſo on; there you have the Apoſtle quoting this very Text (only with a little difference in the word.) Now there are three, or four things that are here to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of Chriſt in his willingneſs to come, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the great work of making Attonement between God and ſinners. <hi>Mine Ears haſt thou opened;</hi> that is one. <hi>Lo I come:</hi> and then, <hi>I delight to do thy will, and thy Law is within my heart.</hi> There are theſe four. Lo I come ſaith Chriſt to do it. It appears plainly that there was a Covenant between the Father, and the Son from al eternity that Chriſt ſhould come in due time into the world, and take our natures upon him: Now the time was for Chriſt to come. There is many that wil agree to do ſuch a thing beforehand: but when it comes to be done (if they ſee there wil be any difficulty in it, and that they ſhal endure ſome hardſhip) they hang back. But Chriſt had agreed from al eternity with his Father, that at ſuch a time he would come into the world, and take the nature of man upon him, and be in the form of a ſervant, and be made a curſe for mans ſins, and al that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46564:149"/> he might reconcile ſinners unto himſelf. This was the agreement. Now the time approaches for him to come, and undertake this great work; when the time came, Obſerve now how Chriſts heart was in it. He did not hang back; he did not repent him of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: But <hi>I come, I come,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) as we uſe to expreſs our ſelves when we are called to do a thing that we love to do; we ſay; <hi>I come</hi> I <hi>come:</hi> now the time is come for you to do that which you undertook to do; to go into the world, to take the nature of man; be made in form of a Servant, and to bear my wrath and to ſatisfie my Juſtice for the ſin of man. <hi>I come,</hi> I <hi>come</hi> ſaith Chriſt and he doth not only come: but come <hi>with delight</hi> to do thy <hi>Will,</hi> and what <hi>was</hi> this wil? It was that Chriſt ſhould be humbled to the death of the Croſs, Though I knew it would coſt my life: yet I delight to do it: becauſe my heart is ſo much ſet upon reconciling Sinners unto thy ſelf, and not only ſo but <hi>thy Law is in my heart,</hi> it hath gotten a deep impreſſion in my heart; thy Law; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that Law of thine whereby I am tyed to this that I have undertaken; for it is within my heart, in the very midſt of my bowels that <hi>I</hi> ſhould do it. And then Fourthly <hi>[Mine ears haſt thou opened]</hi> the words are; mine ears haſt thou <hi>boared.</hi> The meaning of that Phraſe muſt be underſtood by comparing it that way which was of God in the time of the Law, commanding that if a ſervant would not goe out of his ſervice in the years of Jubilee that his maſter ſhould take an awle, and boar his ear and ſo he ſhould be a ſervant forever. This Phraſe hath alluſion to that; as if Chriſt ſhould ſay thus, I am content that I might do this work to be as a ſervant whoſe ear is boared, who muſt be a ſervant for ever: ſo ſaith Chriſt, that I might accompliſh the work of reconciling ſinners to thy ſelf, I am content to be as a ſervant whoſe ear is boared: thereby ſignifieing; that he would be willing to liſten to any thing that ſhould be commanded him. His maſters commandements are not
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46564:149"/> grievous, but it is his meat and drink to do the wil of his Lord.</p>
               <p>Wel might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>As in Chriſts ſtead we beſeech you</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Chriſts heart is much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners that he might bring them to be reconciled unto God, and we in his name come to prevail with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners no get them in unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve what was the firſt Sermon that ever Chriſt preached; <hi>[For the the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand]</hi> that is the firſt Sermon, calling ſinners to repent; becauſe the Kingdome of grace wherein the Goſpel of God ſhould reign, that is at hand ſaith Chriſt, and then Chriſt would preach ſo as to gain moſt, when he had the greateſt Auditors; What was it that he preacht? when he was amongſt the Jews at the Feaſt of dedication, In the great day of the Feaſt (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>Chriſt lift up his voice, and cryed; Hoe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is a thirſt.</hi> A Miniſter when he is to preach to a great Congregation, and he is not like to come to them again, he ſhould ſpeak on ſuch a ſubject that his heart is moſt in. Now Chriſt at the Feaſt of dedicaton he was not like to come to them ſodainly again to uſe ſuch an argument to them; he cryed, <hi>Hoe, every one that is a thirſt, come,</hi> and Chriſt further doth profeſs that it is the end why he came into the World; <hi>To ſave, &amp; to ſeek that which was loſt: Not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> That is the great end that he came into the world about; it was the great ſubejct of his preaching, the great errand that he came into the world about.</p>
               <p>And further obſerve, with what lovingneſs, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and ſweetneſs he doth it; what a gratious invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we have in <hi>Math.</hi> 11. <hi>Come unto me al you that are weary, and heavy leaden, and I wil give you reſt:</hi> and he profeſſes in <hi>John</hi> 6.37, <hi>None that comes to me wil</hi> I <hi>caſt of.</hi> I wil not caſt of any that do come to me: Yea he tells us, <hi>that he wil not quench the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46564:150"/> ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reede;</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſinners he tells them if there be but any ſtirrings of the heart unto him, but as the ſmoaking flax, and as the bruiſed reed; yet he wil not break one, nor quench the other: but he wil encourage new beginnings though never ſo ſmal in ſinners coming unto him. Theſe are the expreſſions of Chriſt towards ſinners to ſhew them how tender he is over them, and when the time drew neer for Chriſt to ſuffer, then (if ever) one would think (if the heart of Chriſt were not much in it) Chriſt would draw back; not only when he was to come into the world: but in the work of his Mediation when he was to ſuffer the violence of the wrath of his father; to be poured out upon him. But mark how he doth expreſs himſelf in <hi>Luk,</hi> 22. <hi>verſe,</hi> 15. And he ſaid unto them, <hi>with deſire</hi> I <hi>have deſired to eate this paſſover with you before</hi> I <hi>ſuffer.</hi> Why did Chriſt deſire? he deſired, that is, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to eat this paſſover; why? becauſe he knew, that aſſoon as ever he had eaten it, he ſhould be called to ſuffer for mans ſin; and to accompliſh the great work of redemption for ſinful men. Then it was to be done, Why? Was there any ſuch cauſe that Chriſt ſhould be ſo ſtrongly upon it to deſire this paſſover? One would have thought, that above al paſſovers Chriſt ſhould have been afraide of this: becauſe this was to put a period to his life: for then Chriſt was himſelf to be made the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to ſuffer: when this paſſover came once, he knew that he was to be made the paſchal Lamb, and yet he doth deſire above al to eate this paſſover, thereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what a minde he had to finiſh the work whereby ſinners might come to be reconciled unto God. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſion there is, I <hi>have a baptiſme to be baptized with, and how am</hi> I <hi>ſtreightned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> Chriſt was ſtreightned in his heart til the work was done. You may ſee how much the heart of Chriſt was in it to be reconciled unto ſinners, when became to do the thing indeed, when the wrath of God was even juſt comming
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46564:150"/> upon him, then (though nature had ſome kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy) he ſaieh, <hi>if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me,</hi> to ſhew how ſenſible his humane nature was of it, yet preſently, <hi>Not my wil but thy wil but thy wil be done.</hi> And the ſcriptue tells us that he did <hi>make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> and that he layd down his life.</p>
               <p>And further after that Chriſt had layed down his life and riſen again, mark one expreſſion more that ſhews how willing Chriſt is to have ſinners reconciled, and brought in unto the Father, and to be at peace with him and that is very remarkable in <hi>Luke,</hi> 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 46. And ſo on, note what was that firſt preaching of Chriſt, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. So here in this world in his bodily preſence, this may ſeem to be his laſt ſermon, What was it he ſaid unto them, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer.</hi> Wel, in verſ. 47. <hi>And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name amongſt al nations begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Jeruſalem,</hi> and ye are witneſſes of theſe things, and then by and by he was caught up into heaven. That which I note this ſcripture for is this; that after Chriſt had been ſo notoriouſly abuſed in his ſufferings, yet this did not hinder his earneſt thirſting after reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that had put him to death, and had ſo abuſed him: ſaith he it is written, <hi>that it behoved Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer &amp;c.</hi> To begin at Jeruſalem, and that is that that I would have done, <hi>The repentance ſhould be preached to al nations,</hi> but begin at Jeruſalem. Why begin at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> Becauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the place where Chriſt was put to death; immediately bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> he was crowned with Thorns, mockt, a Reed put into his hands, ſpit upon, <hi>The Children of Barrabas rather than him,</hi> yea and they cryed <hi>Away with him,</hi> they carried him to the Croſs, and there nailed him til he was dead, and thus they dealt with Chriſt there, yet Chriſt would have repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance preacht to al Nations, but ſaith he, above al, think
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46564:151"/> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and begin at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> let them have it in the firſt place, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that took away my life, that killed me. If any thing in the world could take of the heart of Chriſt from being reconciled to ſinners, one would have thought that that which he had done to him at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould have taken of his heart, but he would have them begin at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is a notable Text of Scripture to us, and you ſhal find it the moſt remarkable converſion and bringing in of ſinners, was at that Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> charged them that they had crucified Chriſt, the moſt famous converſion that ever was made of thoſe people that put Chriſt to death, the moſt famous work of Gods reconcling ſinners to himſelf, of Chriſt bringing in of ſinners by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel it was by bringing in of thoſe ſinners, and therefore in the laſt Sermon that Chriſt preached from Heaven, as the firſt Sermon upon Earth, and the laſt Sermon upon Earth, and the moſt ſolemn Sermon that was at the dedication of the Temple, is altogether about bringing in ſinners to be reconciled to God. So the laſt Sermon that he preacht from Heaven, or that ever he wil preach til he comes again, ſo in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the ſpirit &amp; the Bride ſaid, come, &amp; let him that heareth ſay, Come, and let him that is a thirſt, ſay Come, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wil, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Theſe are the laſt words in effect that are at the concluſion of the book that ever Chriſt would ſpeak til he came to Judgment, never would he ſpeak more in that way to the children of men until he came in a new world: But in this word here is the laſt in this expreſſion; Let him that is athirſt, and whoſoever wil, let him come and take of the water of life freely. Now the Objections they wil come in, as firſt:</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 78.</hi> Objections Anſwered concerning the willingneſs of God and Chriſt to be reconciled to ſinners.</head>
               <p>OBject. <hi>You wil ſay, Why ſhould God do al this? and Chriſt do al this? you tel us that God is ſo willing to be reconciled, and hath ſo expreſt himſelf, and Chriſt ſo willing to be reconciled, and hath ſo expreſt himſelf, by entreating and beſeeching; but both God and Chriſt knows, we can do nothing of our ſelves, and therefore to what end is al this that you have ſpoken? as if we ſhould go into Golgothus or burial places, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the dead to riſe out of their graves, To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would it be? we are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and now if we can do nothing, al that you have ſpoken is but to little purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that purpoſe I anſwer. Firſt though it is true, we are dead in ſins and treſpaſes and are not able to performe any true ſaving work by our own ſtrength, yet firſt al thoſe expreſſions of God and Chriſt in his word, and ſo of the miniſters of God in their names, it may be of this uſe to ſtir up common gifts and graces of the ſpirit of God in us, and that is for to have them ſtirred up to the utmoſt that poſſible may be, people muſt not think (that becauſe they cannot do any worke that is indeed ſaving in it ſelf, any work of ſpiritual life) that therefore there is nothing to be done by them, we are to know that though the ſaving works of God be more rare, yet there are common workes of the ſpirit, that God doth diſpence to many, yea to moſt, and in ſome degree or other to al, eſpecially to thoſe that live under the ſound of the Goſpel, there are none that live under the ſound of the Goſpel but they have ſome common gifts of the Spirit of God, in one degree or other. Now the Lord
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46564:152"/> would have theſe ſtirred up to the utmoſt, (though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in a ſanctified way) and theſe expreſſions of God &amp; Chriſt to ſinners, have a great deal of efficacy in them to ſtir up what common gifts of Gods Spirit you have, and if ſinners do not this they cannot expect that God ſhould do much towards them. Conſider what power God hath given them, and what common gifts they have already, and let that be acted to the utmoſt, and then they may wait ſtil for more from God. This is a truth, that there are none that do periſh, but God hath this to charge them with, that they did not ſtir up the common gifts of Gods ſpirit. Secondly, (though we cannot do any thing of our ſelves) yet God knows that that is the beſt way to conveigh true ſaving Grace unto them, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life into them, it is by this means rather than by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Lord chooſes this way rather than others. <hi>You have received the Spirit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>And how have you received it? by the preaching of the Law, or by the preaching of the Goſpel?</hi> Which way was the conveighance of the ſpirit of God to you? Was it by the preaching of the Law, or the preaching of the Goſpel? not by the one but by the other. (Though there be a great deal of uſe of preaching the Law) yet that which doth conveigh the Spirit and grace into the Conſcience, it is the opening the riches of the treaſure of the Grace of God in the Goſpel, therefore this Objection hath no ſtrength in it; to ſay, we have no power in our ſelves. God doth entreat and beſeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this meanes he puts forth a power into the hearts of thoſe he doth intend to ſave everlaſtingly. If we ſhould entreat dead men to riſe, it were a folly for us, becauſe we cannot conveigh any power into them, but it is not in vain for God, becauſe he is able while he is entreating and beſeeching to conveigh a power into them.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But you ſay in the ſecond place what need the Lord do al this? God might work it by a word from himſelfe, God might preſently ſhew forth his almighty
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46564:152"/> power to bring in ſinners to himſelfe, he need not ſtand praying and intreating and anſwering Objections, bringing of arguments and the like: becauſe he can by his almighty power bring in ſinners; he can breake the ſtouteſt heart that lives upon the earth, and pul downe the proudeſt ſpirit, and therefore what need God do al this.</hi>

                  </gap>t thou O man! that reaſoneſt againſt God? but if you wil have reaſons, there are many to be given.</p>
               <p>Firſt becauſe God having to work with a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he wil work ſuitable to the nature of that creature that he is working upon. If God were to work meerly uppon ſtones, to raiſe out of the ſtones children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> then God would but only ſpeak the word and ſay let it be done, &amp; it ſhould be done, but the Lord loves to do it in a way ſutiable to a rational creature, now that way is this.</p>
               <p>Firſt that the underſtanding ſhould be inlightened, and the heart ſhould be gained and wrought upon, they knowing what it doth, it ſhould come to do what it doth freely and wilingly (though we have no free wil at the firſt) yet when wee do embrace the goſpel, then the Lord doth cauſe the hearts of men to embrace it wiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this is a great part of the goſpel of God to ſhew himſelfe to his creature, he wil work his own work: but ſuch a way as ſhal be ſuitable to his creature. Again, (if the Lord ſhould bring in ſinners to himſelf by his almighty power) then there would not ſo much of the beauty, and riches of his grace appear as there doth this way. If God ſhould effectually work it by his own hand (I ſay) the glory of his grace would not ſo gloriouſly ſhine ſorth. Now it is the ſpecial deſigne that God hath in al his workes about redemption; that the glory of the riches of his grace might appear to men, and Angel's that they might magnify it. Now what can be more to magnify grace? then when a ſinner ſhal come
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46564:153"/> to vieu the ſeveral workings of Gods mercy towards him; how the lord hath provided a way of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that (though the ſoul were backward, and hung of) yet the Lord ſtil followed on, and put on the ſoul, and would not ſuffer the ſoul to die, and perriſh in the ſins of it. What wil magnifie Grace more than this? the way of bringing in ſinners to be reconciled unto himſelf wil be a principal ſubject for the Saints to be bleſſing of God to al eternity. And therefore you Chriſtians that have found the work of God bringing in your hearts to himſelf, obſerve what Gods work is; marke the ſeveral waies of Gods working with your ſouls! For know that thoſe ſeveral waies of Gods working with your ſouls now, wil be the ſubject of your eternal praiſes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And hence it is that God doth go on in ſuch ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expreſſions, that the riches of his Grace might appear the more fully. Yea, and further, that by this means he might gain the hearts of ſinners everlaſtingly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there is nothing wil gain them ſo unto God, as this declaration of the riches of his Grace in the Goſpel. And when the ſinner ſhal ſee, (not only that God is reconciled) but how God hath ſet his heart upon it, how earneſt God hath bin in it, this wil engage the heart of a ſinner for ever unto God, and hence it is; that thoſe ſinners that have felt moſt of the Grace of God bringing them in to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled are thoſe that keep cloſeſt unto God. As for ſuch as are only ſtopt in the way of their ſins by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Law, and are not acquainted with the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Grace of God in the Goſpel, they ſeldom hold out, though for a while out of ſlavery to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they do not commit ſuch and ſuch ſins. This I make no queſtion one may be brought to do; that hath no true ſaving Grace; that they may not dare to commit a ſin in ſecret for a while (meerly our of terror of conſcience) But now theſe men, they are only wrought upon by the terrors of the Law; they ſeldom hold out, but (though conſcience bear a ſtrong hand to keep them from ſin for a long time,) yet at length they break thoſe bonds: But
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46564:153"/> now thoſe that have not only conſcience enlightned, and do not ſee the danger of ſin only, but come to have theſe beames of the Grace and goodneſs of God let out into their hearts, and their hearts are ſo gained unto God by this; that they wil never depart from him: but their hearts wil follow to the bountifulneſs of God. The difference of theſe two may be expreſt by this ſimilitude. Look how it is in froſty wether when the water is frozen; there are two waies to come by the water, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man goes in the morning, and ſees the water frozen, and beates it to pieces, and breaks the yce. but though he doth ſo the next morning he comes, and ſees it frozen as much as before: but when there comes warm weather, and diſſolves the yce then it quite goes away in flakes: ſo hence the hearts of al ſinners are frozen, and God comes with the terror of the Law, and beats them in pieces, and breaks them that way, I but at laſt they freeze again, and grow as hard again as ever: But now when the Lord comes with the beams of his Grace, and ſhines upon them: then their Hearts thaw, and the yce goes away, and their hearts come in flowing to God in another manner than when he comes by his ſtroaks. Now becauſe the Lord ſees that this is ſuch a way to engage the hearts of ſinners to come in unto him, therfore he doth not only put forth ſuch an almighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: but comes in ſuch a way as this; when the ſinner can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be able to perceive the hand of God, that is the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power that doth the work: yet the ſinner can perceive the ſhining of Gods Grace, and his goodneſs, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſons of his love, and the like: this is apparently before the Eyes of the ſinner to admire, and works upon the heart, when the other is more ſecret.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>If God, and Chriſt be ſo willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto ſinners, then you wil ſay, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that there are no more reconciled? One would think that al ſinners in the World ſhould be reconciled to him, hee may reconcile al; Is it not as eaſie for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil one as wel as another? God many times tels us
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46564:154"/> that few ſhal be ſaved: Yea, Chriſt himſelf tels us ſo. Now this that you have preached about Gods, and Chriſts willingneſs to be reconciled; One would think that al the world ſhould come in to be reconciled, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how wil it appear that they are ſo willing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the anſwer to that, the heart of God &amp; Chriſt are much ſet uppon Reconciliation with ſinners; (but ſo as may be ſuitable to other ends that God hath: God wil not have the work of his mercy manifeſted ſo as it ſhal croſſe any other work that he hath to do,) ſo farr as the Glory of his mercy may be manifeſted without croſſing of ſome other work that God hath to do, ſo farr it is let out, not to al. Why? Becauſe it wil not be ſuitable to ſome other ends that God hath to bring about; that he ſhould be reconciled unto al ſinners.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>You wil ſay, to other ends; Why? Do Gods ends croſſe one another? If Gods Heart be for Reconciliation with ſinners, how ſhould this Croſs any other thing that God hath to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer; (though things may ſeem to us, one to be croſs to the other:) yet there is a bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Gods ends, and his waies, and it wil appear plainly one day before the Children of men, and Angels, and it wil be the great work of God, hereafter to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that thoſe things that ſeem moſt to be croſs one to another: yet wil be very Advantagious and aſſiſting to the Promoting, and Coronation of this bleſſed work.</p>
               <p>As it is in the Heavens, there is the motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; they have one motion by which they are carryed one way, and there are the Starres, they have another particular motion of their own, and yet there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the motions of the Heavens. In any work that a man doth, as in a Clock, there is one wheel that runs one way ſo farr, and another meets with it, they ſeem to run quite contrary waies, and yet take them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they do al run to the end that the work is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46564:154"/> for, and yet ſeem to go contrary; the Croſs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wheels is the right going of the Clock: So God ſeems to work in the works of his Grace one way, and in the works of his juſtice another way, and they ſeem to go quite contrary one to the other: But the truth is, they worke al to the end that the workman makes it for; here is the Grace, and mercy of God thus manifeſted in entreating, and beſeeching ſinners to be reconciled; It goes thus far, and then when it hath had its ends, then comes the ſtroak of Gods juſtice, and that ſtriks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and al makes to the beauty of the work of God, that he might have glory in al; So though God be thus earneſt, (yet it is no Argument that al ſinnners ſhould be reconciled:) becauſe it appeares to be the beauty of Gods work which ſhal appear another day; the work of mercy thus farr, and the work of juſtice ſo farr: this we are not able to underſtand throughly now: but it is left to the great day to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Further, It may be anſwered, that theſe expreſſions are cheifly intended towards thoſe that belong to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal election; but revealed in ſuch a general way as none ſhould exclude himſelf: therefore the charge of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is to preach to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe we do not know who they be that do belong to the election, but it is for the ſake of Gods elect ones that theſe things are reconciled in ſuch a ful way as they are; ſuch things ſhould be taught in a Congregation where there are many thouſands: but if there be but a few that belo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g to the election of Grace, God aimes at them moſt: though he may aime at the other too for to leſſen their ſins, and ſomtimes to aggravate them: Yet know, if there be but a few, that it is for you, and for your ſake that theſe things are preacht, and theſe may ſerve to anſwer to thoſe objections.</p>

It were mercy for the Lord once to offer upon any terms to be reconciled unto ſinners, or to ſhew them any favor. Meerly to offer it, that is grace; that is to be admired, and that is more than God hath done to the Angels; he would not do ſo much to them: But now that God ſhould, not only offer: but ſend to feek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee; to cry after you again, and again; to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with you, to entreate, and beſeech, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Miniſters: but by this own ſpirit (for there is the work of that) the ſpirit of God comes and woos, and beſeeches ſinners to come in and be reconciled) Oh ſtand and admire at this forever: Let it take up your hearts to give glory to him and the rather if you conſider theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What it is that God doth entreate and beſeech for?</hi> What is it that you are entreated to do? That that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46564:155"/> ſhal deliver you from the greateſt evil that any creature is capable of, and that whereby you would receive the greateſt good that any creature is capable of; you are entreated not to be miſerable: but to be happy, and not only that you ſhould ſerve God, and not ſin againſt God, and do the works that God requires of you for his glory: but you are entreated to be reconciled, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver your Souls from that depth of miſery, and to be brought unto happineſs, and glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider who you are that are intreated.</hi> Were there any great worth in you; Then you might expect to be entreated, as men that are of great eſtates, they muſt be entreated: But who are you wretched Caitiffes? in your ſelves damned Duſt and Aſhes, fire-brands of hel, ſuch as have made your ſelves fuel for the everlaſting wrath of the eternal God to burne upon; ſuch as deſerve to be caſt out as an everlaſting curſe; ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God: you are intreated.</p>

For the Servant to entreate his Maſter, for the ſubject to entreate the prince, is not ſo much: but for the Maiſter to entreate the Servant, for the prince to entreate the ſubject, this is that that ſhould fil our Souls with a ſpirit of admiration, at the unſpeakable condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions of the moſt bleſſed Majeſty.</p>

Oh! wretched, curſed heart that can ſtand out againſt God; that can ſtand out againſt the the offer of grace in the Goſpel; I ſay, this is a curſed heart to ſtand out againſt the offer of grace though it were no more. If this ſhould be but declared; that Chriſt is come into the world to ſave ſinners: God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, that al thoſe to whom Chriſt is ſo revealed, that they ſhould come flocking unto him, and cry mightily unto God for mercy in Chriſt: but when God doth not only offer his ſon; but comes by the Miniſtry of his word, and by the work of his ſpirit to draw your hearts unto him, and ye thou doſt ſtand out againſt God; againſt al theſe gracious beginings, drawings, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting expreſſions of God; thou doſt ſtand out; Oh!

Thou canſt not now pleade; Oh! ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was ſtrong to draw my heart from God to ſuch and ſuch ſinful waies. Was tentation ſtrong? Why did ever tentation draw more alluringly than God hath drawn alluringly by his goſpel? It is impoſſible that the Devil, and al the world ſhould draw more alluringly to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46564:156"/> any ſin, than God doth draw unto him. Oh! theſe entreatings of God, this gratious way toward ſinners, is that that wil be the greateſt aggravation of the ſins of men that ever was or can be imagined. Only (for the preſent) know thus much; that the mercies of God, that ſhal be the ſubject of the Saints rejoycing, and bleſſing of his name to al eternity; that mercy wil be thy greateſt miſery, and that is a ſad thing for any ſinner to think on, that that mercy that the Saints ſhal be eternally admiring, and bleſſing God for, that that ſhould be my miſery, and ſecret wound, and my greateſt terror, and that is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>

               <p>FOurthly, The Conſideration of this, may be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrength to the Faith of thoſe ſinners that have (in ſome meaſure) been wrought upon by the Grace of God. Thus, if the Lord hath manifeſted ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſtrength of Spirit in ſeeking to ſinners to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, then certainly, when ſinners are reconciled, the heart of God wil forever be with them; he wil not loſe the fruit of ſuch Grace as this; if once he hath brought in, and that in ſuch a way of mercy (Chriſt having brought it) it cannot be any eaſie thing that ſhal take off Gods heart from thee: there was the goodneſs of God towards <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice. I, (but it was not ſo much goodneſs of God unto him, as could not admit of any breach beween God and him. But the heart of God is ſo much in this work in bringing ſinners to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto him, as it is impoſſible that ever there ſhould be ſuch a breach between them, and him again; that ever they ſhould prove to be enemies. Therefore let this ſtrengthen thy heart; when at any time thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'ſt to have jelous thoughts of God, have recourſe to thy firſt calling to God. I went on not many years ago in a wreatched ſinful way; but God came to me, and ſhewed me my evil way, and ſhewed me his Grace: Yea, when I ſtood out againſt his Grace, he followed me, and would not let me be at quiet, but manifeſted it more and more, and hath overcome my heart unto himſelf. How can I think that God that hath done ſo
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46564:157"/> before, that now he ſhould take advantage upon every infirmity? that now every ſin that he ſees in me ſhould make ſuch breaches between him and my ſoul; that he ſhould caſt me from him? Can I think it? Certainly it is a wrong to the Grace of God in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I, but you wil ſay here is the evil, That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my looſe walking I cannot think that ever things were in truth; that I was truly converted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer but theſe two things. Firſt, that if thou canſt but be able to ſay thus in the preſence of God; the Lord knows that there is no weapon of enmity in my heart that is againſt God; that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals unto me to be a ſin, but I know my heart is againſt it; I can appeal to God ſo, and there is no duty that God requires of me, but I know my heart is with it, if the Lord wil but reveal to me. Now in this caſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before felt the work of God drawing thee to Chriſt, and if thy heart be thus kept to God: this is one good Argument that certainly God, and thou are not ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if thou canſt but ſay thus; there is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that is ſo prevalent with me to make me not ſin as this; for fear of breaking peace between God and me; this is the thing that makes my ſin ſting my Soul indeed: becauſe by that I come to loſe ſome of that ſweeneſs of the aſſurance of my peace with God. Canſt thou ſay ſo? keep thy heart but in ſuch a frame (though thou haſt many weakneſſes) that thou canſt ſay; whatſoever ſin the Lord reveals to me yet my heart is againſt it, and whatſoever duty the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of me yet I know my heart is with it, and if there be any thing that I do not know, Oh! that I knew it more and more, and there is nothing that I fear ſin for ſo much as this, becauſe that I ſee it breaks the peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and my Soul. Is it ſo with thy poor ſoul? I pronounce in the name of God Peace be unto thee. Though thy heart be not as thou would'ſt have it, thou
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46564:158"/> maiſt conclude this certainly; God that hath manifeſted ſuch Grace in drawing thy heart unto himſelf at the firſt, wil not caſt thee off. Certainly, God had ſome greater end in working ſo wonderfully towards thee, than to throw thee off; except the Lord had ſome great thoughts of heart in glorifying himſelf in thee, and to do thee good, he would never have wrought ſo upon thy heart as he hath done. There are others that live under the light of the Goſpel, but the Lord doth never come to their hearts to ſpeak to them as inwardly to draw their hearts, and that by his own Spirit as he hath done to thee, the Lord hath not had ſo great thoughts of heart to glorifie his name upon them in the day of his Grace, as towards thee in the working of his Grace: So certainly to thee the Lord is about to do great things; that grace of his that hath been ſo ſtrong upon thee as it hath been, it wil carry thee through al difficulties. Certainly the Grace of God hath been ſtrong, and it wil be ſtrong and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore build upon it. If thou haſt an hard heart, do not ſay; thou haſt an hard heart, and therefore Gods heart is not towards thee. No, but rather ſay, thou haſt an hard heart and therefore thou wilt look towards God to break thy hard heart, and bring thy frozen and cold heart to theſe Beams of Gods Grace, and ſtand under theſe Heavenly influences. If thou beeſt ſenſible of the hardneſs of thy heart, and then to ſit down ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly and heavily, and think becauſe of this God wil reject thee; this is not the way to get thy heart ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but rather cal to mind what the grace of God hath been towards thee, and how the heart of God is towards ſinners to be reconciled unto them, and what he hath done for the like ſuch ſinners as thou art, and ſo keep thy heart under the warme beams of the Goſpel, and thereby thou wilt gain a great deal more than ſitting down in a ſullen way. Thoſe kind of Herbs that grow under the warm Sun grow the better, and the Fruit ripens better than thoſe that grow out of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46564:158"/> the Sunne: So the Heart that can keep it ſelf continually in the Sunne of this mercy and goodneſs of God, thus expreſſing himſelf in the Goſpel, willing to be reconciled to ſinners; this heart wil thrive more abundantly, than thoſe that ſhal ly down ſullenly, and diſcontentedly, This is a mighty encouragement for al ſinners to come to be reconciled; a mighty ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to them, the Lord invites, and beſeeches in the Goſpel, and ſends his miniſters to do it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them that they ſhould do it in his name. What ſhould hinder them, but that any ſinner (none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſhould come, and be reconciled? We cannot tel who they are that ſhal not be reconciled, and therefore we may ſay concerning any particular ſinner; What ſhould hinder thee but that thou ſhouldeſt come in to be reconciled? And if God entreates, and Chriſt entreates and Miniſters entreate, and thou entreateſt: What letts thee but that thou maiſt be reconciled: As, <hi>the Eunuch ſaid. Here is Water enough, why may I not be baptiſed? So here is mercy enough, why maiſt thou not be reconciled?</hi> Haſt thou ſuch thoughts as theſe are? See that God is willing to be reconciled to ſinners wel, when I get home I am reſolved to throw my ſelf before the Lord Chriſt, and I am able to cry to him for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, for I am damned and undone for ever elſe, and and I heare that there is a way to be reconciled to him: wel, this ſhal be my work now; I wil ſet upon it preſently, I wil never leave crying to God til I have found Gods Grace comming to me. Art thou reſolved upon this? Wel go on; and fal down in thy crying to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; make this point part of thy petition; Lord, I have heard that thou art willing to be reconciled; now Lord here is a wretched ſinner comes in to be reconciled to thee what hinders now when both ſhal entreate? Suppoſe two were fallen out one with the other, but now when both ſides are wrought upon, and one, he profeſſes himſelf not only willing, but earneſtly deſirous to be reconciled
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46564:159"/> and the other he comes, and expreſſes himſelf ſo too, ſurely both theſe wil agree. Now it is true many times between man and man, their expreſſions are but very ſlight, and there is not that at the bottom of their hearts that they expreſs with their mouthes. When two are fallen out, and one comes to them, and ſaith, why, wil you not be at peace with ſuch a man? Oh! yes ſaith he I am willing. So, come to the other, and he ſaies the ſame, he is willing; and yet their hearts are not right (perhapps) one to the other. But now in this caſe between God and thy poor ſoul, be confident that on Gods ſide, it is moſt real, and do thou but make it out that thy heart is real in deſiring after peace with God, and fully underſtand what thou doſt when thou doſt deſire peace with God, [So] that thou wilt not be at peace with any ſin, and deſire it fully and then when thou ſhalt get it, then thy heart ſhal be praiſing God, and ſay, I ſhal live to the praiſe of God for ever; and that ſhal be my endeavor. I would faine have at, but wil God be at peace? Yes, God ſhal get as much as thou ſhalt by it, he ſhal thereby get that that he did eſpecially intend and aime at in making the world. The great deſigne that God had in making the world was to magnify the riches of his mercy, and if thou beeſt one that God hath faſtned upon to ſhew the riches of his mercy, and Grace, he ſhal get that Glory thereby to his name, that he did moſt intend when he made the world. Therefore, though thy ſoul be pretious unto thee, know that Gods Glory is more pretious unto him than thy ſoul can be to thee, therefore God is more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of thy life (with thoſe that ſhal be ſaved hereafter) than they can be deſirous to be ſaved themſelves; this is a certaine truth, becauſe that God ſhal get more by the ſalvation of that ſoul than the ſoul ſhal get. You get ſomething, but God gets much more; now then if God be ſeeking after that that doth ſo much concern you,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46564:159"/> and you know this day that Gods heart is more ſtrongly ſet uppn it than yours, one would think that this ſhould be a mighty encouragement for any ſinner to come in to be rconciled. And therefore go on in thy way, let not tentation come take off thy heart (though yet God ſeems as an enemy to you.) We know that <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart was as much towards his bretheren, as his bretherens hearts were towards him; <hi>Joſeph</hi> dealt in a rugged way, as if he had been their enemy, yet then was his heart towards them. And ſo go on in thy way of ſeeking the Lord, and though God ſeeme to be as an enemy, yet know that the heart of God is as much towards thee as thy heart can be towards him, and Chriſt looks upon thee as one that he ſhal get glory to himſelf by for ever. The good Lord ſay Amen. It ſhal be ſo.</p>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46564:161"/> of which you may read in the 7 Chapter of the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and upon that occaſion of the troubles that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had by <hi>Achan,</hi> this vally was called the vally of <hi>Achor,</hi> for the vally of <hi>Achor</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>the vally of trouble, valla tribulationis,</hi> the vally of trouble; ſo alluding to that name <hi>Achan.</hi> Now it is true that generally, or by very many, theſe words are carried thus; That God wil ſo work things about, as to cauſe the troubles of his people, to be but doors of hope to let in Mercies to them, and there is a truth in that doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal point, but not a truth in the grounding of it upon this text, for the meaning of the text is otherwiſe. <hi>The vally of Achor.</hi> Though the name ſignify trouble, yet the truth is that this vally of <hi>Achor</hi> was a delightful vally, a very fruitful vally, it was juſt after the enterance into the Land of <hi>Canan</hi> that God gave it, and God here doth allude ſtil to the way of marriage, expreſſing his love to the ten tribes, that he would receive them again, and marry them unto himſelf, in that way that they did uſe to marry amongſt the Jews, and the way was this, amongſt them, when they did marry any, according to the ſtate of the husband he uſed to give her gifts; commonly ſome field or piece of Ground, and if he were a rich man, then a larger piece of ground, or a more fruitful peece of ground, and ſo according to the height of his condition was his guift, So ſaith God. I wil give you a vally of <hi>Achor</hi> for a door of hope, as you when you take a ſpouſe to your ſelves, then you uſe to indow her with ſome piece of land, or ground, according to your eſtate, and that you give to her as a teſtification of that Love, ſhe is to expect from you for the future. So I wil give you a vally of <hi>Achor,</hi> I wil beſtow freſh and choyce mercies upon you for the preſent, and theſe mercies ſhal be in a way of dowrie, as a teſtification of abundance of future good you ſhal receive from me; this is the ſcope and ſence of the Holy Ghoſt in theſe words. As when God gave the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the land of Canaan, he gave
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46564:162"/> them this Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> as the enterance at the door of Hope unto that Mercy, that they ſhould injoy from him in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> That this Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> was a delightful fruitful Valley, it appears evidently from that Text in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.10. <hi>And</hi> Sharon <hi>ſhal be a Field of flocks, and the Valley of</hi> Achor <hi>a place for the Heards to lie down in, for my people that have ſought me:</hi> Here God promiſes the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the people that did ſeek him, and the Heards ſhould lie down in it, it was a very fruitful place, and therefore God maketh ſuch a promiſe; Now though it hath the name of trouble, yet we find that God promiſeth it to his people as a token of his Mercy, and ſo it is to be underſtood in theſe words, therefore having the meaning of it, now we come to the Doctrinal Concluſion, that is to be grounded upon this Scripture thus opened unto you; the Doctrine then is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That the Mercies that God beſtows upon his Church and his people, are doors of hope to future Mercies</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſent Mercies that God grants unto his people, are doors of hope to future Mercies; Al Gods Mercies to his Saints are inlets unto further Mercies. This is the high priviledge of the Saints of God, it belongs not to every one. The wicked indeed when they receive any thing from God, they may write their <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> upon it, this is like to be their PORTION, and they may wonder that they have any thing at al; but the Mercies of God unto his people may be al called doors of hope; the name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> may be written upon them: as we may read in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 30.24. <hi>When Rachel had once conceived, and did bear a Son, ſhee called his name Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhal add another;</hi> when ſhe had one ſhe made it a pledge of another, <hi>the Lord ſhal another.</hi> So it is with Gods mercies to his people, they are <hi>Joſephs,</hi>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:46564:162"/> may conclude, that God ſhal add another; when God delivered his people out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 13.15. ſaith <hi>Moſes, Thou haſt guided them unto thy holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation;</hi> thou haſt guided them, that deliverance <hi>Moſes</hi> tooke as a certain Argument of Gods further Mercy toward them; thou haſt guided them. When God did but begin with <hi>David</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.12. to ſhew but a little Mercy, an outward Mercy to him, <hi>David</hi> did conclude that God had eſtabliſhed him in the Kingdome. How ſo? God had ſhewed a great favor outwardly unto <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> could conclude, that that favor he did receive, was bur an inlet unto more, an argument of eſtabliſhment of him in his Kingdome; God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and he wil deliver (ſaith the Apoſtle.) As God maketh way in his wrath by leſſer judgements upon the wicked, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.45. ſo God maketh way for his Mercy, by preſent leſſer Mercies unto his Children.</p>

God may take notice of them for a while, and there is an end of them, but in his Goodneſs towards his people, there God intendeth a glorious edifice, to raiſe up a building that ſhal be to his eternal praiſe, and therefore when as one layeth a ſtone to raiſe up a high building, he laies it ſo as he fitteth it for another ſtone to be laid upon it, if I lay ſome ruins of a building, but only a heap of ſtones, I care not how I lay them, but if I intende to raiſ up a building, then I lay one ſtone as it may prepare for another; So doth God in his dealing with the wiked, he heaps his mercies upon them, let them come as they wil, but when he diſpenſeth his mercy to his people, then he intendeth a building, and he laies them in that order, and in that ranke, firſt one and then another, ſo as when he hath laid one, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what that mercy is, one may ſee an empreſſion in that mercy for another, as it were caling for another mercy to be laid upon it.

His Children have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Judgments, many times God cometh in a Judgment, and then he lets the wicked proſper, I but his Juſtice hath it's courſe under ground, and runs out of ſight, and comes up again, that is very obſervable and may concerne our preſent occaſion, for our inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in Gods dealing with his peopel, in bringing of them out off captivity, and repairing the wal and the Temple, God had made many glorious promiſes to his people, what he would do for them, in returning them from captivity, and building of their city again, wel, after the ſeventy yeares came, God did begin to worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully gloriouſly for them, but if you obſerve a little and read the ſtory you may finde that between their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to returne from the captivity and the finiſhing of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46564:165"/> Gods mercy in building the Temple and the wal, they were as long a time as they were in their captivity, That was ſeventy years, they were ſeaenty years in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and from the beginning of the worke of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to the end of it, they were ſeventy years more, but ſtil the goodneſs of God ran along, there was an eye of mercy and goodneſs upon them, though it ſeemed to ceaſe for the preſent, yet it caried it through at the laſt. It may much concerne us now we are ready to be diſcontented and troubled, when God is in a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe we have not al preſently, al is not come now juſt when we would have it we are ready to complain, O! How long hath the parliament bin ſet and litle hath bin done, why? it was Gods way with his own people, though they had ſuch particular promiſes of that glorious deliverance, yet it was ſeventy years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was fully accompliſhed, and if God be but in a way of mercy towards us, but a going on, you have but a little now now and a litle another time, yet we are not to repine at this, for ſtil mercy is going on, though there may be interruption for the preſent. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many times we thinke there is an interruption, when indeed there is none at al, but our miſtake, if we did but underſtand things, we ſhould ſee a moſt beautiful concatination of mercyes and connection of mercies there is no interruption; yea further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very interruption that we think there is, may be one of our greateſt mercies; Gods ceaſing in comunicating one kind of mercy, may be but a preper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for another kind of mercy, for a greater mercy, and therefore we are not to be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

God complaineth thereof his
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46564:165"/> people, ſaith he, <hi>when</hi> I <hi>would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of Ephraim was diſcovered,</hi> when I would have healed them, God many times is in a way juſt of healing his people, and when he would have healed them when he is in a way of mercy, and he expects that they ſhould follow him in this way of Mercy, why, then their iniquity is diſcovered, and then they break out into notorious iniquities, and ſins, and they come and make a ſtop, and ſhut the door of mercy againſt them, ſo that (I ſay) as we are to be warned in regard of our publique ſins, now God is in a gratious way of publique mercies, there was never a time wherein we had need of more warning to be watchful, to take heed what we do, that our iniquity may not be diſcovered, for now God is about to heal us, he is thinking to heal us, Oh! let us now take heed of our lives, and ſo it ſhould be particularly the care of every ſoul. Is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to heale, is God in a way of mercy to thy family, to thy body, to thy ſoul at any time? now take heed to thy ſelfe, that thy iniquity be not diſcovered, for now wil the devil come, and tempt thee to break out in ſome notorious ſin, that he might cut off the way of Gods Grace, that he might ſhut that door of mercy that God is now opening to thee; in <hi>Zacharie</hi> 8 15.16. Saith God there, So again have I thought in theſe daies to do wel unto Jeruſalem, and to the houſe of Judah, feare you not, (mark you what follows) and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts againſt his neighbour, and love no falſe oathes, for al theſe things are the things that I hate ſaith the Lord, mark the expreſſion of God, it doth very nearly concerne us, now we may wel apply that 15. verſe unto the condition of England at this time, I thought in theſe daies to do wel unto this people, and to the houſe of Judah, but in theſe things that I ſhould do (ſaith God) look to your ſelves, you muſt not think that when I am going on in a way of mercy, you may do what you liſt, but theſe things I wil do but it is
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46564:166"/> upon this condition, that you follow God on in that way, if God doth open a door to us, if we would not have it ſhut, he expects that we ſhould come and enter in at that door, that is, cloſe with him in that way of mercy he is doing; wel, but then ſeeing that our ſins have made the interruption, and it is not alwaies that Gods preſent mercies are certain arguments of further mercies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ſhal we know when we may draw an argument, to aſſure our ſelves from that mercy we have now, that there is further mercies intended for us? This you may remember in the beginning of the point, I told you it was a priviledg of Gods ſaints, and yet every one wil be ready to ſnatch at it, &amp; to conclude to themſelves; wel, God is a God ful of mercy and therefore becauſe he beginneth to ſhew mercy to me, he wil go on, ſurely <hi>I</hi> ſhal find favor, it hath been his way and courſe to deal thus with his people and therefore ſeeing he hath delivered me from one evil, he wil deliver me from another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(Bretheren) it is the uſual way of wicked men to catch at the priviledges of the Saints, as if they were their own, we have a notable example for this in the propheſie of Jeremiah, that is worthy of our obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.2. It is an example there of <hi>Zedekiah, Zedekiah</hi> was a wicked man, and yet he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this, and promiſed to himſelf, that what privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the people of God had in former times, he muſt needs have the like, mark what he ſaith now; <hi>Inquire I pray thee of the Lord for us,</hi> Nebuchad-nezar <hi>King of Babilon, maketh war againſt us, if ſo be the Lord wil deal with us according to al his wonderous works that he may go up from us,</hi> Mark (ſaith <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) Oh! inquire, Oh! let us know the mind of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wil deal with us according to al his wonderous works; God had dealt with his people according to his
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46564:166"/> worderful works had dealt wonderfully for his people, and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a wicked man, and the wicked people that were with him, they were ready to flatter themſelves with hope, that God would deal with them as he had done with his people heretofore, worderfully, but they were deceived. And ſo people when they heare of a priviledg of the Saints, for them to promiſe to themſelves, that they ſhal have the like from God, that his peopl have (I ſay) they wil be miſtaken, for the promiſes that are made in Scripture of Mercy, they are the inheritance of Gods Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>This is the inheritance of my ſervants</hi> (Saith God.) When God made a promiſe to his people of Mercy there, I but (ſaith he) this is the inheritance of my Sarvants, it belongs not to al, it is their inheritance, their portion; what have others to do with the inheritance of Gods people? When a Saint of God looks into the word of God, and reads the word, he may ſee every promiſe, every expreſſion of Gods goodneſs, as a part of his inheritance, and take it, it is thy inheritance, though thou inheriteſt not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches, thou mayeſt have ſhort or little comings in, yet know thou art an heir of al the glorious promiſes that are written in the Book of God, they are thy inheritance. A wicked man when he reades in the Scripture, he can take no ſuch delight in it: for indeed he may reade many promiſes, but they are none of his inheritance, they are the inheritance of Gods people. There is a great deal of difference between an heire riding through his Fathers ground, and a ſtrangers riding through it: juſt the like difference there is between a carnal man reading the ſcriptures, &amp; a Saint: An heir rideth through his ground and ſeeth fruitful fields, and pleaſant meadows, and ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh! was not there ſuch a time when you began to have frequent workings of Gods ſpirit in you? you began to have light darted into your Conſciences, to have the ſpirit of God drawing your hearts, that when you came to the word, you found the word coming with power, and the ſpirit of God ſealing it, and your hearts did begin to yeild, and to melt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, Oh! what might you have gotten if you had gone on, if you had followed God in thoſe convictions of conſcience, and in thoſe beginnings of troubles you had, and workings of Gods ſpirit, what might you have come to now? There was a door of hope, but fooles and wretched men to ſtick in the birth and come not forth; and alas! May not many ſay, Oh! that I had a door of hope, there was ſuch a mercy of God towards me, but wo to me the door is ſhut, I find my heart ſhut up, and my conſcience ſhut up, and my heart now is hard, but it was beginning to be ſoftened? but Oh! how hard it is now, God was opening my heart, but now it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with me, and for ought I know God is gone, and Chriſt is gone?

               <p>If one Mercy be but an inlet to another Mercy, then this ſhould teach al the people of God, to be content to beare one affliction, though it be but a way making for another affliction; the argument runs thus, It is true there cometh an affliction, and by and by another, and that makes way for another, and ſo the cloudes riſe after the raine, and how many poor weak hearts are plunged and dejected, they can bear one affliction, I, but when another cometh, and another cometh, at length they fal down under the weight of their afflictions, but if thou be one that belongeſt to God, and haſt the aſſurance of

But here is the difference between that which is done by the ſtrength of a natural conſcience, and that which is done out of a principle of true ſanctifying Grace; I beſeech you obſerve it.

But I muſt leave particular applications now, and come to the more general, and therefore ſeeing that this is the thing our condition requires, we muſt venture upon it at leaſt now, though I ſhould never doe any other thing, I could not forbeare at this time, that God hath opened a doore of mercy, a doore of hope to us, to al England, I ſuppoſe every one ſees it, and among the people of God it is the mater of their diſcourſe, when they come together.

Surely this door of hope could not have been opened by al the skil and power of men, they could not conceive the way, God came by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand and opened it, a mighty hand, an out ſtretched arme of God hath taken the barrs away, and opened this door of hope, now to abuſe it, or not to thank the name of God in that, in which Gods hand hath feemed remarkable, Oh! this is a greivious ſin, and a mighty provoking of God, ſince this is the door that Gods mighty hand hath opened.

It is a door that many adverſaries have laboured to ſhut a long time, Oh! what devices, councels, plotts, al the waies that poſſibly could be deviſed to ſhut this door, but God hath kept it open, and put in a bar to keep it open notwithſtanding our adverſaries; We may ſay of this as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe ſpeaking of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther door, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. <hi>There was an effectual door opened, and there were many adverſaries for it,</hi> ſo we may ſay that here is a door opened, and many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaties there be.

The Church of God when Chriſt had called by his ſpirit, afterwards ſtirred by his Grace, began to indeavor reformation, and the very firſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring of reformation, when they were but entered upon the door of reformation, Oh! it was very ſweet in the Noſtrills of God, very ſavory, my hands dropped with Myrrh, and my fingers with ſweet ſmelling Myrrh upon the handles of the lock, when I was but indeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to open and to reform, then my indeavors were very ſavory to the Noſtrills of Chriſt. So the very fingers of our worthies, do they not ſmel of ſweet Myrrh? Are they not ſavory in the Noſtrills of God, and in the Noſtrills of his Saints? They are ſavory when their hands are but upon the very handles of the lock; therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have ſuch a precious door as this is, we are bound to ſeek God for the opening of it, and the continuing of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46564:179"/> it open; but yet further.</p>

That is the oppreſſion that cyeth in Gods eares; The oppreſſion of the poor, the oppreſſion of bread, that cryeth, but when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhal cry to their Father, Father, theſe proude prelatical men are thoſe that take away our bread, they have cryed up to God, and God hath heard their crie, and now hath opened a door to deliver us from conſcience oppreſſion, and to grant us bread again, to grant bread to us, not only ſo but it opens to this treaſure too, it opens to the treaſure of the purity of Gods ordinances, and deliverance of us from thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. If I ſhould name but this one burthen that is upon
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46564:179"/> the Miniſters of God, and that woful burthen that is not upon their ſhoulders only, (if it were only ſo it were enough) but upon the conſciences of men, and that is the admitting of ſo many prophane wretched creatures to the Sacrament; it is an inſupportable burthen to any conſcientious man, that hath to do in ſuch a thing as that was; thoſe that are oppoſite to God, in the way of prophanneſs, that we muſt come and tel them here, take the body of Jeſus Chriſt that was given for thee, no conſcientious man but was oppreſſed by this and not only this, but for you alſo, for certainly (brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en) there ſhould be an excluding of ſuch from thoſe holy things, and to whom hath God committed the truſt of this great ordinance of his? certainly he hath committed the truſt to the Church; whereſoever there is a true Church, there this truſt is committed, that if you wil own your ſelves for a true Church certainly you are truſted with it. But you wil ſay, we have no power to do it; pleade not ſo, you have a power, Chriſt hath given a power to every Church to do it, to purge out the old leaven, &amp; therfore know when there is nothing between your power, &amp; the the excerciſe of your power, but only ſuffering and affliction, your power is no power if you excerciſe not that power that Chriſt hath given you, the ſin wil lie upon you, and this is no plea that there is a ſuffering between your power and the excerciſe of it. Now if God open a door this way, and we ſee ſome light to deliver our conſciences from ſnares, and from theſe burthens, Oh! it is a bleſſing and mercy; it maketh a door to open to al Gods mercies, for this is the reaſon many ſeperate from your congregations, not becauſe they judg your Church a falſe Church, or your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery a falſe Miniſtery. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have not al the ordinances; of God in the purity of them, there are ſuch corruptions that they cannot medle with al.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They cannot enjoy al Gods Ordinances; though the Church be true, and the Miniſtry true, yet certainly
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46564:180"/> thoſe that are conſciencious, and look upon them, they cannnot but be afraid, therefore if there be a door of hope to let in our brethren the out-caſts of Iſrael, and to joyn with them in communion, certainly every gracious heart cannot but think this a precious mercy, that God ſhould open the door of hope, and this ſhould be your prayer and endeavour to the utmoſt you can, that this door of hope may be ſo wide, that your Brethren may come and enter in with the peace of their Conſciences; As heretofore it hath been the honor of <hi>England,</hi> that others have come out of other Countries for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and have been ſheltered here, that now it be not the diſhonor of <hi>England,</hi> that her own children ſhould be driven out from her; becauſe they cannot have liberty of Conſcience, and that in things which ſome think they are but of an indifferent nature; if I ſay that now it ſhould be diſhonored by caſting out, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your Brethren, becauſe they cannot have peace of Conſcience, Oh! what a diſhonor wil it be if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue? therefore if God be opening his door, this ought to be your endevor to ſeek God, and to endevor that it may be ſo wide, that thoſe that you Judge in your Conſciences to be faithful and godly, may come in and enter in at this door, and enjoy peaceable communion with you.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This door it may further the ſetting up of Chriſt in his Kingdome of Glory, Chriſt hath been ſet up much in <hi>England</hi> in his prophetical, and Kingly, and Prieſtly Office, now that Chriſt may be ſet up in the Church to rule upon his Throne, to have a door of hope to open to that, that ſhal have an influence to the general reformation of al the Chriſtian Churches in the world, for the beating down the Kingdom of Antichriſt, ſuch a door of Hope have we opened to us. Yea, and further beſides this,</p>
               <p n="11">11. Conſider what a dreadful thing it will be, if this door of Hope ſhould be ſhut; though it is true, we have
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46564:180"/> ſome comfortable Evidence it ſhal not (as I ſhal ſpeak more by and by) yet who knows but that through our wretchedneſs, and want of preparation of the hearts of the People of this Land, but that this door may be ſhut again: Oh! the diſmal darkneſs if once it ſhut again! Oh! the contempt that wil be upon al the Saints of God! Oh! the pride, and Rage, and Inſolency of the Inſtruments of Antichriſt againſt them, if this door be ſhut again! Oh then, if we ſhould once again ſay, We looked for light, but behold darkneſs; Oh! it would be blackneſs of darkneſs then; what Flies would come out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> then? How would all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry flow in upon us? what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your Poſterity, and little ones? How would they ever be nouriſhed up in the Knowledg of God and Chriſt? And you are not likely to enjoy your outward Eſtates neither: if any of you think you have back doors to get out from Religion to keep your Eſtates, you may be miſtaken, if this door be ſhut: therefore you have need to follow God all you can in this way to keep it open.</p>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46564:181"/> them, and therfore now we know how they are called by others, what titles now they have different from their former, thus God hath fulfilled it in part upon them, and beleeve it we ſhal have a ſhare in that mercy even that door that is opened to us in that way, is ſo opened as it ſhal not be ſhut againe; wherefore then to conclude al.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let every one take heed, let the fear of God be upon every ſoul, eſpecially any of you that are more eminent than others in any place, take heed, as from God this day take warning, that thou be not the leaſt interruption in the great work that God is about; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if you be, if you wil ſtand in this door to hinder the good that God is letting in, you wil certainly be overcome, you wil certainly be vanquiſhed, you can never hinder the work God is about, and therefore thoſe men that are ſuperſtitous, Antichriſtian, and would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that work (I ſay) thoſe men are in ſome reſpects more unhappy, than the ſuperſtitious and Antichriſtian men in former times, becauſe that thoſe that before did ſeek to maintain ſuperſtition, &amp; popery, &amp; the like, then it was a time that God was peacable, and ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enemies of his people, and was content it ſhould come in then, I mean content by way of permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not by way of approbation, and did ſuffer it, but now is the very time that God is quite rooting it out, it is the very time that God is ſeting himſelf againſt it, and therefore they that ſhal now ſeek to uphold it, they are men that are moſt unhappy; becauſe at that time they ſtand in the doore, juſt when God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with his power, and with his ſtength. O! take heed you have no hand in interupting the great work God is about, and (my brethren) that we may give God the honor of this door of hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider with our ſelves, what we would have given heretofore, that we might have had ſuch a
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46564:182"/> door of hope, I am perſwaded many of us would have laid down our lives, O! Lord if we might have purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much good as now is come to <hi>England,</hi> we would have counted our deareſt heart blood wel ſpent. Now ſeeing we would have given ſo much heretofore, O! what ſhal we render now? that ſtrength that we ſhould have ſpent under the cruel rage of our adverſaries, O! Let that ſtrength be now ſpent to the praiſe and honor of our God under his mercies: there is a notable place of ſcripture for that in the 119. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 134. God had delivered him from his oppreſſours, and therefore he would keep his ſtatures; Thou haſt (O Lord) deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me from my oppreſſors, therefore wil I keepe thy ſtatutes; So that ſtrength that we ſhould have ſpent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cruelty of our oppreſſors, now ſhould be ſpent in the keeping of Gods ſtatutes, and following the waies of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let our hopes now riſe higher, God would have our hopes raiſed higher, ſeeing he hath opened a door let us ſtand in the door, and let us not be diſcouraged, though we think perfect reformation a difficult thing, yet (brethren) perfect reformation now is not more difficult, than that we have now was difficult a year or two agoe; a year or two agoe that we now have was as unlikely, as perfect reformation now is; and therefore we are to raiſe up our hopes to higher &amp; greater things: and therefore the King when he ſmote the ground twice or thrice, he ſhould have ſmote ſeven or eight times. And (brethren) we have to deale with a great God and his deſigne is to magnifie his great name in the good of his Church, in the 17. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> Thou haſt ſhewed thy marvailous loving kindneſs, The word as is is taken by ſome may be read, Lord, make thy loving kindneſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, miraculous. God loveth to make his loving kindneſs to his Church miraculous. Now (brethren) we may hope to have that from God, that ſhal make God appear a wonder-working God, that ſhal ſet up
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46564:182"/> God in his glory, now this reformation in our land, it ſhal ſet up God in his glory, that we hope for, our hope is at the loweſt except we hope for ſuch great things, as may ſet out God to be an infinite and great God. An ordinary reformation in deliverance from the oppreſſion of the ſtate, it is not enough to ſet out the infinite pardoning and loving kindneſs of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then for the concluſion of al, O! let every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now goe on in the name of God, and ſtand in the door, and look how God is comming, and cloſe with him, and meete God in every way of his mercy, in <hi>Reve.</hi> 4.1. the text ſaith, There was a door opened in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, (brethren) certainly there is a door opened in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, let us incourage our hearts, and do what we can in our places, and with the ſtrength that we have, let us open our hearts, and open our deſires to him, let him know that we are willing to venture our eſtates, our liberties, our lives, and al that we are or have to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a good cauſe, God hath done much, he wil do much in <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> I have brought you out of the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> open your mouth wide that I may fil it, I have done great things, brought you out of the land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> open your mouth wide that I may fil it.

This is a good rule when they come not into Theaters, but into places of Gods aſſemblies, when Aged men come not into Theaters to ſee plaies, but when they come to worſhip God, and hear his word, that young men ſhould riſe up before them, and reverance their Age, and ſhew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and reſpect to them; and know I ſpeak not this as a moral work, but as that wherein you ſhould ſhew the feare of God.</p>

As Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates that fal from Gods ſervice diſgrace it, and (as much as in them lies) tel to the world, that there is not that good in the ſervice of God as others beare them in hand there is, but thoſe that are Old, and can ſay as <hi>Policarpus,</hi> I have found him a good maſter al this while, they hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Gods waies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is honorable becauſe there are ſo few that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue til they be Old in the waies of Godlineſs; If we ſet many plants, and moſt of them vaniſh and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but there is one or two that flouriſh, and come to be trees, and ſo proſper, we love them the better, and delight in them the more: ſo becauſe God ſees there are ſo few that continue in his waies, therefore thoſe that do are the more prized by God, and the more honored by God; So <hi>Paul</hi> he tells us that of the moſt he was forſaken; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 15.16. He praies for the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> becauſe he had kept by him when moſt in <hi>Aſia</hi> had forſaken him; that is honorable. Again,</p>
               <p>Thoſe that continue in the waies of Godlineſs they are honorable before the Lord, becauſe they have paſſed through many difficulties in the waies of God. A ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that hath paſſed through man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That he honored <hi>Abiathar</hi> becauſe he had ſuffered ſo much affliction with his Father of Old: ſo God wil honor thoſe that have ſuffered many difficulties, thoſe that have gone through many changes of time, and yet continued upright God wil exceedingly honor; in Luke, 18. <hi>Becauſe you have indured with me in the time of temptation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> I <hi>have appointed unto you a Kingdom,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) Again.</p>
               <p>It is an honorable thing to be Old in the waies of righteouſneſs, becauſe theſe have much acquaintance with God, they come to be of Gods long acquaintance. Now we delight much if we can meet with one that is of
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46564:191"/> our old acquaintance, we ſay Oh! Such an one is my Old acquaintance, he was my fathers acquaintance, therefore we prize him now. Now an Old man that hath been a Godly man a long time, he is our Old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, an Old acquaintance of God our Father, and therefore we honor him; in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 15.23. Where <hi>Moſes</hi> praiſes God (ſaith he) he is our God, and our Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then it is an honor to you that you are Gods that are our Fathers, that you are our Fathers Saints; if God be honored for being our Fathers God, then you are honored for being one of our Fathers Saints, Gods Saint who is our Father. We reade of <hi>Moſes</hi> that having been but forty daies converſing with God upon the Mount, and his Face did ſhine, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God forty daies makes his face ſhine, what wil it be to converſe with God forty years?

And I dare ſay, There is no gracious Old man living this day in England, but ſees indeed cauſe of giveing God abundance of praiſe, that ever they lived to ſee ſo much appearing of God as they do. Do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome troubles and interuptions vex and fret. <hi>Zachary,</hi> 3. And the latter end, that at the laying of the Foundation of the Temple, the old men that were there they fel a weeping and crying, the young men they ſhouted indeed, and they praiſed God, but the old men they cryed, becauſe they knew what was before; ſo? many young men now they ſhout, and bleſſe God for what they ſee, but many old men they weep, becauſe it is not as formerly, they can remember a great deal more peace in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies; now there is ſuch a deal of diſtraction &amp; diſſention, therfore they are ready to weep, when the foundation of the Temple, when the work of reformation is laid; Oh! they are ready to weep becauſe of ſo much diſtraction, but put all together, and certainly never any man ſince England was a nation, no, nor ſince the begining of the world, hath ſeen more of God and of his gracious waies to a people, than you have ſeen, therefore be not froward for that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, but give God the praiſe and glory for that that is wel begun.</p>

If your fore-fathers in time of reformation, ſhould have ſaid (as many of them ſaid) ſhould we be wiſer than our fore-fathers? We ſhould have continued in Popery ſtil, and yet we did think wel that they before us did decline from their forefathers, therefore we muſt look to the truths that are come up, that are manifeſted in ſeveral Generations; not that any truth is new, but the manifeſtation of ſome truths are more evident in ſome generations than in others, and therefore in 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.12. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of being eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth. As in <hi>Luthers</hi> time there was a preſent truth, the point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was the preſent truth of that age, and ſo in theſe times there are preſent truths made knowen, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our outward and ſpiritual liberties. There was a great deal of falſe divinity before preached amongſt you, even concerning your eſtates, that you had nothing of your own, but al was at the abſolute wil of thoſe above you, you had no propriety at al; and for ſpiritual liberty, we know in what bondage we were there. Therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor now to underſtand theſe truths, and give God the glory of them, before you do imbrace theſe preſent truths. It is ſtrang that men ſhould be ſo much ſet upon former things, as to neglect the grace of God for the preſent, and al becauſe of thoſe that were before. As now among the Fathers (as we cal them Fathers) though they be to be reverenced for their graces, yet they living among heathens, and coming newly out of heatheniſme, they were faine to yeild as much as ever they could, to the heathens among whom they lived, and did ſo, and therefore there were many corruptions among them, and ſo the firſt reformers coming newly out of popery,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46564:196"/> they were fain to yeild, and did yeild ſo far as they could for the gaining of them, therefore we muſt not make that that was heretofore, the rule of things, but bleſs God for what is revealed at the preſent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another work of Old men for beautifying their crown in righteouſneſs is this, you that are ancient often think of eternity, you are now juſt a launching into the ocean of eternity, and in a few years there wil be a mighty difference between your conditions, between that that is now, and that when you ſhal be entered upon an eternal eſtate. Think much of eternity al you that are ancient. Al young ones ſhould have their thoughts much weighed with eternity, nothing wil take of the thoughts of Old and young more, than to have them ballaſed with the thoughts of eternity, eſpecially thoſe that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Take heed of thoſe things that are the uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that accompany Old age; as namely, timer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Oh! you would faine die in peace, you have lived al this time in peace, and are loath to ſuffer any thing for the truth; <hi>Policarpus</hi> did not ſo, when he was eighty ſix yeares of age, he was couragious. So labor you for young mens courage for God, even in the time of your old age. Take heed of ſuch a ſurlineſs and pettiſhneſs of ſpirit, that becauſe you have not hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received ſuch things, therefore now you wil not. Remember it is reported of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when <hi>Tiberius</hi> would have had Chriſt to be honored as a God, Oh! it muſt not be done, (forſooth) why? <hi>Becauſe the Senate did not firſt motion ſuch a thing,</hi> becauſe it was not firſt motioned by the Senate. Many times in your meetings, though many be convinced of a good thing, they wil give notes againſt it, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that were moſt ancient did not firſt move it, becauſe it was put on by the young ones firſt, therefore though it be never ſo good, they wil ſtick to their Old
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46564:196"/> waies, O! take heed of ſuch a ſurlineſs and pettiſhneſs of ſpirit, Remember the Gretians, it was ſaid of them, that when they wiſhed a curſe upon their enemies, it was that they ſhould pleaſe themſelves in bad cuſtomes; and it is a greivious curſe indeed, when old men are ſet upon ſuch things, that they wil not bauk what they have done heretofore; And then again, another thing for the honor of your crown in the waies of Righteouſneſs, is,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When God ſhal take you out of this world, (as ere longe muſt needs be) labor before to prepare your ſelves ſo, as you may die in faith, in the hope of the glorious things, that God is working for the Church in this latter age, for certainly God is doing great things for his Church in this latter age of the world, greater things than ever yet have bin done, and thoſe that are a live may live to ſee glorious workings of God in the world, more than before; and though you are not like to live to ſee the great things that God intendeth to do, yet thus far you may glorifie God before you die, die in faith; as old Jacob did. It is a notable expreſſion of old Jacob, when he lay a dying he called his ſons to him, and ſaith in <hi>Gene.</hi> 48.21. <hi>And Iſarael ſaid to</hi> Joſeph, <hi>behold I die, but God ſhal be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers;</hi> So you that are old when you ly upon your death beds, when other young ones com about you, ſay thus to them, behold I die, but aſſure your ſelves God wil be faithful in his promiſes to the Church, there are glorious things adoing for his people; in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.22. the faith of Joſeph is there commended, in that when he dyed he gave order concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his bones; why? what work of faith was it, for him to give order for his bones to be caried out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> yes, it was a work of faith, that he beleeved God would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his promiſes; do you die ſo beleeving that God wil fulfil thoſe bleſſed promiſes he hath made to the Churches. And,</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Take heed now in this your old age of a worldly
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:46564:197"/> ſpirit, this is that that is charged upon old men, and yet it is the moſt ſtrange and unreaſonableſt thing that can be, and it is very obſervable, that God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed length of daies to the quite contrary, and yet we ſee this diſtemper of heart prevails with old men exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.16. <hi>but he that hateth covetuoſneſs ſhal prolong his daies;</hi> and yet it is obſervable that old men are moſt ſubject to it, and yet the ſcripture promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth length of daies by hating covetuouſneſs; none of you but would fain live a year longer, now hate cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs eſpecially in theſe times. There is nothing wil more diſhonor your crowne, than the ſin of covete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in theſe daies, becauſe if ever there were times that God called for ſpiritual and heavenly hearts, now it is; in <hi>Keve.</hi> 4, we read of the diſcription of the ſeveral ages of the Church, one was like a Lion the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Calf, the third a Man, the forth an Eagle, the laſt ſtate of reformation of the Church ſhould be like an Eagle that is the hearts of thoſe that lived in that ſtate ſhould be Eagle like, ſoaring a loft in heavenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and ſo it becometh thoſe that are old. Be not now baſey ſparing and pichning becauſe God hath now great works to do for his people. I have read of a people in India, that worſhipped the tooth of a beaſt, and when it was taken from them, they offered an incredible maſs of treaſure to recover the tooth of the beaſt againe, becauſe they put religion in it; If theſe heathens ſhould be willing to diſburſe an in creedible maſſe of treaſure, to regaine that religions relique of a tooth of a beaſt; how willing ſhould you be freely to lay out your eſtates for the reformation of religion for the getting of the truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46564:197"/> honor of them, that at the very time that <hi>Hanibal</hi> was in the feild, they would be purchaſing of thoſe fields when their enemy was there, and would give a round ſume for them. Be not ſo diſtruſtful, but be willing to diſburſe in this way, that may be ſo much for the reliefe of our brethren in Ierland, and for the ſetting up of the goſpel there, though for the preſent there be ſome hazards; Ordinarily thoſe that are Old are ful of fears and diſtruſt, but of al they ſhould be the freeſt from them; And in the laſt place.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Let your praiers be, and your imbracing of the goſpel ſo for the preſent, as you may have hope when you die, that you ſhal leave the goſpel as an inheritance to your children afterwards; with what comfort may an aged man or woman die, unleſſe they may have hope the goſpel ſhal be left to their children; Not many years ſince when old people died, that had any ſight in the waies of God, they died with trembling hearts, for they thought, Now I am going, and what miſeries my Child may be brought to ſee I know not, it may be he may be brought up in popery and Idolitry, but now when you die, you may have a hope to leave the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as an inheritance to your Children; eſpecialy if your prayers be ſtrong, and your imbracements of it as it ought to be; It is ſaid of <hi>Juſtin</hi> the younger, that he ran mad with this conceite, that the Roman Empire ſhould decay, in his time, he was ſo extreamly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a thought. So it ſhould be with every generation, what! that the goſpel ſhould decay, and the entail and evidence of it be cut off in my time, it ſhould go near every one of us, and therefore incourage your ſelves, and let there be a youthful vigour in your ſpirits, to ſee to propagate the Goſpel, that you may have hopes to leave it to your poſterities when you are gone and it is not longe you ſhal have it, for conſider, you have had a bleſſed talant of grace in the time God hath afforded to you, I dare ſay that there was never
